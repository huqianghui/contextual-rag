#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping  
Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.

#### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care  
##### Extranodal Extension  
ENE is defined as extension of metastatic carcinoma within lymph node, through the capsule, and into the surrounding connective tissue, regardless of associated stromal reaction. Histopathologic designations for ENE are as follows:  
· ENEn (none)  
· ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm)  
· ENEma (ENE>2 mm or gross ENE)  
ENEmi and ENEma is used to define pathological ENE nodal status (Figure 7.4). The distinction between ENEmi versus ENE, will not affect current pN category, but this designation is recommended to allow standardization of data collection and future analysis.

##### Depth of Invasion  
DOI assesses the invasiveness of a carcinoma, regardless of any exophytic component. It is measured by first finding the "horizon" of the basement membrane of the adjacent squamous mucosa (Fig. 7.5). A perpendicular "plumb line" is established from this horizon to the deepest point of tumor invasion, which represents DOI. The DOI is recorded in millimeters. Measurements in millimeters can easily be accomplished by printing rulers on acetate sheets, which can be overlaid onto glass slides. Figure 7.6 demonstrates DOI of an ulcerated carcinoma.

##### Resection Margins  
The ideal manner of intraoperative margin assessment is the "specimen driven approach." Direct discussion between surgeon and pathologist at specimen hand-off allows for correct anatomic orientation and identification of any intra-operative non-margin tissue tears or cuts. The pathologist maps the specimen, paints the different margin planes with unique colors, and documents the designations. In the event of non-margin tissue tears, these non-margins should be inked first using a unique color (e.g., yellow). This obviates the problem of ink running. The pathologist then makes multiple cuts into the margins at 5- to 10-mm intervals perpendicular to the resection plane. Initial gross assessment yields important preliminary information. This is followed by targeted microscopic examination of margins of interest. The margin sections should be taken perpendicular to the resection plane. The distance between carcinoma and resection margin should be reported in millimeters.

##### Worst Pattern of Invasion  
Worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) is a validated outcome predictor for oral cavity squamous carcinoma patients in multivariate analysis. To simplify prognostication and enhance adaptation, the only cutpoint recommended for assessment is whether or not WPOI-5 is present. WPOI-5 is defined as tumor dispersion of ≥ 1 mm between tumor satellites. With respect to low-stage oral cavity squamous carcinomas>4 mm DOI, the presence of WPOI-5 is significantly predictive of locoregional recurrence and disease-specific survival (p=0.0008, HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.48, 4.41, and p=0.0001, HR 6.34, 95 % CI 2.50, 16.09, respectively) and the probability of developing locoregional recurrence is almost 42%. Figures 7.7 and 7.8 illustrate examples of WPOI-5. Tumor dispersion is assessed at the advancing tumor edge. The most common WPOI-5 phenotype is tumor dispersion through soft tissue. Dispersed extratumoral perineural invasion, or extratumoral lymphovascular invasion, also can qualify for classification as WPOI-5.

##### Perineural Invasion  
Perineural invasion (PNI) should be subclassified as either intratumoral or extratumoral (Fig. 7.9). Involvement of named nerves should be specifically reported. PNI should be subclassified as focal or multifocal. Extensive multifocal PNI is usually extratumoral and frequently associated with a "strand-like" tumor phenotype. The largest nerve diameter should be reported for multifocal, extratumoral PNI.

##### Lymphovascular invasion  
Lymphovascular invasion should be reported as either intratumoral or extratumoral, as well as focal or multifocal.

##### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influences outcome (Level III). An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer registrars to obtain important information
