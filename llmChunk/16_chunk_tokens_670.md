#### Notes:  
1\. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes  
2\. ENE. is defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of musculature, dense
tethering or fixation to adjacent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial
plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction
Note: A designation of "U" or "L" may be used for any N category to
indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (U) or below
the lower border of the cricoid (L)  
Similarly, clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as ENE(-)
or ENE(+)
