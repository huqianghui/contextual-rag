<figcaption>Fig. 13.3 T1 for the supraglottis is defined as tumor limited to one
subsite of supraglottis (shown here in the epiglottis) with normal vocal
cord mobility Fig. 13.5 T2 for the supraglottis is defined as tumor invading the
mucosa of more than one adjacent subsite of supraglottis or glottis or
region outside the supraglottis (e.g., mucosa of base of tongue, vallec-
ula, and medial wall of pyriform sinus) without fixation of the larynx
(shown here with tumor involvement in the suprahyoid and mucosa of
the infrahyoid epiglottis)</figcaption>

thyroid cartilage (shown here with invasion of the supraglottis and
vocal cord with vocal cord fixation) Fig. 13.8 T3 for the supraglottis with invasion of the preepiglottic tis-
