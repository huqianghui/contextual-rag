The risk of regional metastasis is generally related to the
T category as well as worst tumor pattern of invasion
(WPOI). Cervical metastases are uncommon among tumors
with nonaggressive WPOI (types 1, 2, 3) with increasing
likelihood of metastasis for WPOI-4 and WPOI-5. In gen-
eral, cervical lymph node involvement from oral cavity pri-
mary sites is predictable and orderly, spreading from the
primary to upper, then middle, and subsequently lower cervi-
cal nodes. Any previous treatment of the neck, through sur-
gery or radiation, may alter normal lymphatic drainage
patterns and result in unusual dissemination of disease to the
cervical lymph nodes. Cancer of the mucosal lip, with a low
metastatic risk, initially involves adjacent submental and
submandibular nodes, then jugular nodes. Cancers of the
hard palate likewise have a low metastatic potential and
involve buccinator, pre-vascular facial and submandibular,
jugular, and, occasionally, retropharyngeal nodes. Other oral
cancers spread primarily to submandibular and jugular nodes
and uncommonly to posterior triangle/supraclavicular nodes.
Cancer of the anterior oral tongue may occasionally spread
directly to lower jugular nodes. The closer the primary is to
the midline, the greater the propensity for bilateral cervical
nodal spread. Although patterns of regional lymph node
metastases are typically predictable and sequential, disease
in the anterior oral cavity also may spread directly to bilat-
eral or mid-cervical lymph nodes.The lungs are the most common site of distant metastases;
skeletal and hepatic metastases occur less often. Mediastinal
lymph node metastases are considered distant metastases,
except level VII lymph nodes (anterior superior mediastinal
lymph nodes cephalad of the innominate artery).
