The "inside out" pattern of maturation is another characteristic feature; keratinizing tumor cells are localized to the periphery of tumor islands, and proliferating tumor cells are centrally located (Fig. 10.3) This is the converse of the maturation pattern usually seen in non-HPV-mediated keratinizing squamous carcinoma. Anaplastic tumor cells with multinucleated or bizarre nuclei can be seen in HPV-mediated p16+ oropharyngeal cancers, and are a poor prognosticator.9

Cervical lymph node metastases to level II/III from an unknown primary are staged in this chapter if p16

<figcaption>Fig. 10.3 In the context of oropharyngeal cancer, these histologies are predictive of HR-HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and p16 overexpression.5 (a) These cancers typically are composed of basaloid tumor cells with minimal cytoplasm. Individual cell keratinization may be observed at high power; however, overt keratinization is usually not seen at low-power observation. (b) "Inside out" maturation-The peripheral rim of the tumor islands is composed of flattened keratinizing tumor cells, while the proliferating more immature cells are centrally located. This is distinct from the usual non-HPV-mediated keratinizing squamous carcinoma, which reveals central keratinization, and proliferating tumor cells at the periphery of tumor islands. (c) Anaplastic tumor cells, as well as multinucleated tumor cells can be seen in these carcinomas Fig. 10.4 HR-HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancer can form cystic metastases in cervical lymph nodes, whereas the primary carcinoma is usually solid.5 It is unnecessary to document extranodal extension in this context. This phenotype, plus p16 overexpression, can be especially useful for tumors of unknown primaries. (Top) Uniloculated cystic metastases. (Bottom) The metastatic carcinoma forms a ribbon-like (transitional) pattern with variable tumor maturation appearing as flattened keratinizing cells</figcaption>
