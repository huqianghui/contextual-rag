Macroscopic ENE (ENEma) is defined as either
extranodal extension apparent to the naked eye at the time of
prosection and extension >2 mm beyond the lymph node
capsule microscopically. At the time of dissection, extrano-
dal extension can be identified as irregular, firm, white/grey
tumor at the interface with soft tissue. This still requires his-
tologic documentation. The "naked eye" assessment is
important if no residual lymph node structure can be found
microscopically. By contrast, intact lymph node capsules are
smooth, and separate easily from surrounding fat. ENEmi
and ENEma are used to define pathological ENE(+) nodal
status. Stretching of the lymph node capsule by carcinoma
does not constitute ENE; microscopic evidence of breaching
the capsule, with extension into surrounding soft tissue, with
or without tissue reaction, constitutes ENE.  
For assessment of pN, a selective neck dissection will ordi-
narily include 15 or more lymph nodes, and a comprehensive

neck dissection (radical or modified radical neck dissection)
will ordinarily include 22 or more lymph nodes. Examination
of fewer tumor-free nodes still mandates a pNO designation.
