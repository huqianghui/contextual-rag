Both CT and MR imaging allow evaluation of nodal
morphology to determine possible tumor involvement.
Levels IA, IB, and IIA are the most frequently involved
sites, and these levels should be scrutinized specifically
with concern for rounded contour, heterogeneous texture
including cystic or necrotic change, enlargement, and ill-
defined margins. It also is important to be cognizant that
nodal spread may be bilateral, particularly with anterior
and/or midline oral cavity tumors. Midline nodes are con-
sidered ipsilateral. Skip nodal metastases (level IV without
level III involvement) while described with lateral tongue
tumors, appear to be rare. As previously described, PET/CT
may also be used to improve predictive yield for nodal
metastases by the addition of physiologic information, and
ultrasound may be an additive tool for evaluation of indeter-
minate nodes. PET/CT is the only modality to allow whole-
body evaluation of distant metastatic spread, and the upper
lungs and bone should always be reviewed as potential met-
astatic sites on any staging neck CT or MR imaging.  
The risk of distant metastasis is more dependent on the N
than on the T status of the head and neck cancer. In addition
to the node size, number, and presence of ENE, regional
lymph nodes also should be described according to the level
of the neck that is involved. The level of involved nodes in
the neck is prognostically significant for oral cavity (caudad
nodal disease is worse), as is the presence of ENE from
individual nodes. Imaging studies showing amorphous spic-
ulated margins of involved nodes or involvement of inter-
nodal fat resulting in loss of normal oval-to-round nodal
shape strongly suggest extranodal extension; however, path-
ological examination is necessary to prove its presence. No
imaging study can currently identify minor ENE in meta-
static nodes, microscopic foci of cancer in regional nodes or
distinguish between small reactive nodes and small nodes
with metastatic deposits (in the absence of central radio-
graphic inhomogeneity).
