The known lack of ability for radiographic imaging accurately to define ENE suggests the need for stringent criteria prior to assigning ENE on a clinical basis. Imaging studies showing amorphous spiculated margins of involved nodes or involvement of internodal fat resulting in loss of normal oval-to-round nodal shape suggest extranodal spread of tumor but are not sufficient without corresponding evidence on physical examination. Pathological examination is necessary for documentation of such disease extent. No imaging study (as yet) can identify microscopic foci in regional nodes or distinguish between small reactive nodes and small malignant nodes (unless central radiographic inhomogeneity is present). Both contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allow excellent evaluation of the primary oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal tumor and of nodal drainage sites. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is being used with greater frequency for staging, treatment evaluation, and surveillance. It may offer an advantage in detection of an otherwise clinically occult primary tumor. Imaging staging of a known oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal tumor requires a systematic review of the primary tumor, nodal drainage sites and imaged potential sites of spread. For this purpose, structured reporting may offer advantages to the radiologist for ensuring that critical information is not omitted.
