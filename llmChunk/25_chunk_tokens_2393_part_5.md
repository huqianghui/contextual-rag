##### Tobacco Use  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is hard
to accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, â‰¤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but â‰¤ 20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.
