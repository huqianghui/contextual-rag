regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to further hone the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions.

##### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of additional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all illnesses in the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of these parameters. General performance measures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the clinician report performance status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance measures, along with standard staging information. An interrelationship between each of the major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

##### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse negatively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in pack years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week and number of drinks per day will provide important data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss of>5% of body weight in the previous 6 months. Depression adversely impacts quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the medical record. AJCC Level of Evidence: III

##### Tobacco Use  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well established. However, exactly how this could be codified in the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is hard to accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important element of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.
