mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract. The
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer
Staging Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition) introduces a num-
ber of significant changes. These include a separate staging
algorithm for human papilloma virus-associated cancer,
restructuring of the head- and neck- specific cutaneous
malignancy chapter, division of the pharynx staging system
into three components, changes to the tumor (T) categories,
addition of depth of invasion as a T characteristic in oral
cancer, and the addition of extranodal tumor extension to
the node (N) category.  
Maintaining a balance between hazard discrimination,
hazard consistency, desirable spread in outcomes, predic-
tion of cure, and the highest possible compliance was para-
mount.1 As the world moves toward personalized medicine,
demand will increase for individualized prediction of risk
and outcomes, which may ultimately eclipse the traditional
groupings of cancers used in staging. The complexity asso-
ciated with defining individual risk, prognosis, and benefit
from treatment is undeniable but it may eventually be miti-
gated by relying on computerized algorithms presented in a
user-friendly format on the handheld devices so ubiquitous
in modern society.2 These may be applied through nomo-
grams relying on key anatomic, biologic, and clinical fac-
tors. Nonetheless, a feasible pretreatment approach (i.e.,
clinical TNM) applicable in all medical settings and to all
patients should be maintained both for defining treatment
and for evaluating the effect of treatment across popula-
tions and time. Thus, the 8th Edition represents a compro-
mise between a very accurate, but very complex system
(where compliance would be low) and a very simple
system, which would permit high compliance at the expense
of reduced predictive capacity.  
Cancer staging is used worldwide in countries with widely
varying levels of resources. Assuring harmony between the
AJCC and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)
staging systems was an important goal and it could not have
been accomplished without the wisdom, collegiality, and
sense of purpose displayed by members of the UICC Head
and Neck Committee. We are especially indebted to the tre-
mendous work ethic and attention to detail exhibited by
members of the AJCC Head and Neck Expert Panel and its
many subcommittees and disease site leaders. Both groups
have balanced the need for a worldwide system with the need
for incremental improvement.
