#### Clinical or radiographic extranodal extension  
ENE worsens the adverse outcome associated with nodal
metastasis. The presence of ENE can be diagnosed clini-
cally by the presence of a "matted" mass of nodes, involve-
ment of overlying skin, adjacent soft tissue, or clinical signs  
of cranial nerve or brachial plexus, sympathetic chain or
phrenic nerve invasion. Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR)
generally has low sensitivity (65-80 %) but high specificity
(86-93 %) for the detection of ENE. The most reliable imag-
ing signs are an indistinct nodal margin, irregular nodal cap-
sular enhancement or infiltration into the adjacent fat or
muscle, with the latter finding on CT and MR imaging as the
most specific sign of ENE. Ultrasound appears to be less
accurate than CT and MR imaging, but ENE is suggested by
interrupted or undefined nodal contours with high-resolu-
tion ultrasound imaging. The absence or presence of clinical/
radiologic ENE is designated ENE(-) or ENE(+),
respectively.  
#### Imaging  
Cross-sectional imaging of the oral cavity may be performed
with either CT or MR imaging, depending on availability,
patient imaging tolerance, contrast allergies, and cost. With
either modality, the coronal plane view-either as direct MR
imaging or from reformats obtained from axially acquired
thin-slice CT-allows excellent evaluation of the floor of the
mouth.9 CT offers some advantage over MR imaging in the
evaluation of cortical bone erosion, although MR imaging
appears to be more sensitive but less specific for the detec-
tion of bone marrow invasion by tumor.10, 11 MR imaging
offers the additional advantage of evaluation of perineural
tumor spread, which for oral cavity tumors is primarily along
the inferior alveolar nerve (CNV3) of the mandible and the
greater and lesser palatine nerves (CNV2) of the maxilla.
Gadolinium contrast is always recommended unless contra-
indicated by prior reaction or very poor renal function.
