Finally, there is the potential for confusing nonaggressive pattern of tumor invasion with noninvasive carcinoma. The epithelial crypts of Waldeyer's ring are lined by specialized reticulated epithelium, which is thinner than stratified squamous epithelium and characterized by abundant intraepithelial lymphocytes and mononuclear cells. The basement membrane in this region is composed of fine, discontinuous fibers, thus enabling lymphocyte trafficking.11,12 Because of the lack of a complete, well-defined basement membrane, the idea of in situ carcinoma within these crypts is incorrect. HPV-mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma most often reveals a nonaggressive pattern of invasion (e.g., transitional pattern, which is reminiscent of urinary bladder carcinoma). The smooth, ribbon-like contours of this pattern plus the lack of desmoplastic response might lead the pathologist toward a mistaken diagnosis of in situ carcinoma (Fig. 10.4).
