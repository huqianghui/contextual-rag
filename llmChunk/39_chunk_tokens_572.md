This list includes histology codes and preferred terms from
the WHO Classification of Tumors and the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Most of
the terms in this list represent malignant behavior. For cancer
reporting purposes, behavior codes /3 (denoting malignant
neoplasms), /2 (denoting in situ neoplasms), and in some
cases /1 (denoting neoplasms with uncertain and unknown
behavior) may be appended to the 4-digit histology codes to
create a complete morphology code.

\* Histology is not ideal for clinical use in patient care, as it describes an
unspecified or outdated diagnosis. Data collectors may use this code
only if there is not enough information in the medical record to docu-
ment a more specific diagnosis.
