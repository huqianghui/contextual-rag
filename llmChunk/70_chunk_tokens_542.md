Cancers of the larynx are staged using the TNM system. The
T category is unchanged from the American Joint Committee
on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition. N
category, however, now includes extranodal extension (ENE)
in categorizing metastatic cancer to neck nodes. The effect of
ENE in prognosis on head and neck cancers not caused by
human papilloma virus (HPV) is profound.4 Including this
important prognostic feature was considered critical in revis-
ing staging. Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse
prognostic factor are based on histopathological character-
ization of ENE, especially the distinction between micro-
scopic and macroscopic (or gross) ENE.3,5,6 Therefore, only
unquestionable ENE is used for clinical staging. For clinical
ENE, the known inability of current imaging modalities to
define ENE accurately mandated stringent criteria for assign-
ing a clinical diagnosis of ENE. However, unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion
of skin, infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adja-
cent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction)
supported by strong radiographic evidence permits classifi-
cation of disease as N3b. Pathological ENE also will be
clearly defined in this chapter. As per the "uncertain rule" of
the AJCC/UICC staging, which mandates that the lower cat-
egory always be assigned in ambiguous cases, a case should
be categorized as ENE(-) unless there is unquestionable
ENE.  
A staging system should address and respond to new
information that influences patient outcome. An appropriate
balance between complexity and compliance (ease-of-use) is
necessary for worldwide adoption. The TNM system has
strongly predicted prognosis over the years and is adopted
worldwide. The introduction of the new parameter of ENE
better fits the prognostic modeling from large datasets. It
must be balanced, however, by the ability to derive accurate
information from clinicians caring for patients with head and

neck cancer in many different environments. Thorough
descriptions of ENE are included in the Definition of ENE
and Description of its Extent section of this chapter.
Effectively, ENE will increase the nodal category by 1 (dem-
onstrated in this chapter).
