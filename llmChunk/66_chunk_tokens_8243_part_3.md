For the purpose of staging, the nasoethmoidal complex is divided into two sites: nasal cavity and ethmoid sinuses. The ethmoids are further subdivided into two subsites: left and right, separated by the nasal septum (perpendicular plate of ethmoid). The nasal cavity is divided into four subsites: the septum, floor, lateral wall, and the edge of naris to mucocutaneous junction.

#### Regional Lymph Nodes
Regional lymph node spread from cancer of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is relatively uncommon. Involvement of buccinator, prevascular facial, submandibular, upper jugular, and (occasionally) retropharyngeal nodes may occur with advanced maxillary sinus cancer, particularly those extending beyond the sinus walls to involve adjacent structures, including soft tissues of the cheek, upper alveolus, palate, and buccal mucosa or overlying skin. Ethmoid sinus cancers are less prone to regional lymphatic spread. When only one side of the neck is involved, it should be considered ipsilateral. Bilateral spread may occur with advanced primary cancer, particularly with spread of the primary beyond the midline.

#### Metastatic Sites
Distant spread usually occurs to lungs, but occasionally there is spread to bone.

#### RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION
##### Clinical Classification
The assessment of primary maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, and ethmoid tumors is based on inspection and palpation, including examination of the orbits, nasal and oral cavities, and nasopharynx, and neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves. Nasal endoscopy with rigid or fiberoptic flexible instruments is recommended for inspection and biopsy.

Neck nodes are assessed by palpation. In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal mass should be measured. Biopsy, when indicated, is done with a fine needle and not open approach and is included in clinical classification if done. The three categories of clinically involved nodes for the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus are N1, N2, and N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to describe the N category, regional lymph nodes should also be described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
