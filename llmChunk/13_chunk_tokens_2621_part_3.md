tumor cannot be identified on clinical examination and
with currently available radiographic imaging techniques.
This dilemma of the occult primary has been partially
resolved by improved understanding of tumorigenesis and
availability of cytologic and histologic methods to identify
EBV- and HPV-related tumors, which are known to pre-
dominantly arise in the nasopharynx and oropharynx,
respectively. In spite of modern technology, the origin of
the primary tumor does remain unknown in all other
patients whose primary tumor is clinically and radiographi-
cally occult and who present with EBV-negative and HPV-
negative metastatic cervical node(s). Furthermore, TO will
still exist in salivary gland primary sites based on histology
of the lymph node.  
Three separate approaches are employed to stage patients
who present with an occult primary tumor. The primary T
category is described as TO and the N category is designated
according to the respective anatomic site based on EBV and
HPV status: (1) patients with EBV-related cervical adenop-
athy are staged according to Chapter 9 (Nasopharynx); (2)
patients with HPV-related cervical adenopathy are staged
according to Chapter 10 (HPV-mediated oropharyngeal
cancer (p16+)); and (3) all other patients with EBV-
unrelated and HPV-unrelated cervical adenopathy are
staged according to the N category described in this chapter.
The stage groupings for these specific patients with occult
primary tumors (TO) take into account the varying prognos-
tic impact of metastatic cervical adenopathy for their differ-
ent diseases. The stage groupings for EBV-related
nasopharynx and HPV-related oropharynx cancer are
described separately in the relevant chapters. Stage group-
ing for the patient with EBV-unrelated HPV-unrelated
occult primary tumor is described in AJCC Prognostic
Stage Groups in this chapter.
