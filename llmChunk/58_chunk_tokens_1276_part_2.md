Provide a description or map of the regional lymph nodes
and node groups that the cancer affects. Unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE extension (i.e., defined as invasion of
skin, infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent struc-
tures on clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus,
sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunc-
tion) is a sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clini-
cal ENE (ENE.) and qualifies as ENE(+) for definition of cN.  

Evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction should be sought
(testing sensation and motion to command) and skin should
be examined for evidence of invasion by underlying nodes.
Palpable neck nodes should be considered in terms of their
location (level in the neck), size, number, character (smooth  
or irregular), attachment to other nodes, and mobility. Nodes
that do not move in all directions may be invading nearby
structures. Invasion of the sternomastoid muscle and or cra-
nial nerves is associated with lateral motion but restricted
ability to move the node along the cranial-caudal axis.
Inability to move the node at all (without moving the head) is
worrisome for ENE, though the suspicion should be tem-
pered for smaller nodes with limited mobility in level
II. Assignment of ENE should be based almost entirely upon
the physical examination, rather than upon imaging studies;
gross ENE is required to raise the stage beyond the assign-
ment based upon node size and number and this may be
overestimated with current imaging modalities.
