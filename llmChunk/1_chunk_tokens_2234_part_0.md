The major changes in the 8th Edition for head and neck cancer reflect the changing environment of head and neck oncology. The areas highlighted in this section include general changes and additions to cancer staging that apply across most Head and Neck sites. The specific changes for each site are detailed in the respective chapters.

#### New and Restructured Chapters
A major addition is a restructured head- and neck-specific cutaneous malignancy chapter. This acknowledges the increasing need for head and neck oncologists to stage cutaneous malignancies.
The Pharynx chapter has been divided into three separate anatomic regions that better reflect the different diseases arising in the pharynx.
- Nasopharynx has its own chapter recognizing the unique biology and etiology of this disease.

- HPV-negative oropharynx and hypopharynx remain together in view of their shared biology and typical risk factors.
- A new chapter describing the staging of human papilloma virus-associated (HPV) oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) has been added.

The rapidly increasing incidence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) associated cancers of the tonsil and tongue base has posed numerous challenges in diagnosis, management strategies, and outcomes reporting.
