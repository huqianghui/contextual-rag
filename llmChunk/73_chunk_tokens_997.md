Clinical staging is essential for squamous cell carcinomas
of the larynx. Assessment is primarily based on inspec-
tion of the larynx via indirect and direct endoscopy.  
Palpation of sites (when feasible) and of neck nodes is
essential. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is
required. Complete endoscopy, usually under general
anesthesia, is performed after completion of other staging
studies, to assess the surface extent of the tumor accu-
rately, assess for vocal cord mobility, and facilitate biopsy.
A careful search for other primary tumors of the upper
aerodigestive tract may be indicated because of the poten-
tial of multiple independent primary tumors occurring
simultaneously.  
Primary site clinical staging for supraglottic carcinoma is
based on involvement of various subsites of the supraglottic
larynx adjacent regions and vocal cord mobility. Imaging
may be helpful to identify occult submucosal transglottic
extension. Imaging criteria that define T3 lesions are exten-
sion into the preepiglottic space (paralaryngeal fat) or tumors
that erode the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage. Tumors
that erode the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage are defined
as T4a tumors.  
In clinical evaluation of the neck, the maximum size of
any nodal mass should be measured. There are three catego-
ries of clinically involved nodes for the larynx: N1, N2, and
N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior
mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph
nodes (Level VII). In addition to the components to describe
the N category, regional lymph nodes also should be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
Provide a description or map of the regional lymph nodes
and node groups that the cancer affects. Unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE (i.e., invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, or invasion of cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve with dysfunction) is a
sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE
(ENE.) and qualifies as ENE(+) for definition of cN.  
The known lack of ability for radiographic imaging to
define ENE accurately suggests the need for stringent crite-
ria prior to assigning ENE on a clinical basis. Imaging stud-
ies showing amorphous spiculated margins of involved
nodes or involvement of internodal fat resulting in loss of
normal oval-to-round nodal shape suggest extranodal spread
of tumor but are not sufficient without corresponding evi-
dence on physical examination. Pathological examination is
necessary for documentation of such disease extent. No
imaging study (as yet) can identify microscopic foci in
regional nodes or distinguish between small reactive nodes
and small malignant nodes (unless central radiographic
inhomogeneity is present).Both contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allow excellent evalua-
tion of the primary tumor and of nodal drainage sites.7

Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is being used with
greater frequency for staging, treatment evaluation, and sur-
veillance. It may offer an advantage in detection of an other-
wise clinically occult primary tumor.  
For T1 and T2 tumors of the glottic larynx, cross-sec-
tional imaging may be used to ensure that the clinical diag-
nosis of early stage lesions is correct. Imaging may be used
as an important adjunct to identify the presence of submu-
cosal extension, especially at the anterior commissure
where lesions may spread anteriorly along Broyle's liga-
ment to involve the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage.
Imaging also may identify glottic carcinomas that have
occult transglottic or subglottic spread. The normal para-
glottic space often is difficult to routinely detect at the level
of the true vocal cord due to the close apposition of the
lateral thyroarytenoid muscle to the inner cortex of the thy-
roid cartilage. Tumor erosion limited to the inner cortex of
the thyroid cartilage indicates a T3 lesion, whereas carci-
nomas that erode the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage
define a T4a tumor. Stage T4 (a and b) is difficult to iden-
tify based on clinical examination alone, because the
majority of the criteria cannot be assessed by endoscopy
and palpation.
