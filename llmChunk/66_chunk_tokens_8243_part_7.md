Smoking history should be collected as an important element of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.

#### RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS
The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.12 Although this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medicine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore, the existing models that have been published or may be in clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the statistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evaluated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.
