#### Summary of Changes  
<table>
<tr>
<th>Change</th>
<th>Details of Change</th>
<th>Level of Evidence</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chapter Title</td>
<td>The chapter title has changed to reflect the focus on all of oral cavity, which includes mucosa of lip but not external (dry) lip.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICD-O-3 Topography Codes</td>
<td>External upper lip (C00.0), external lower lip (C00.1), and external lip, NOS (C00.2), and commissure of lip (C00.6) have been removed from this classification and added to the classification for cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck (chapter 15). External lip (including the dry vermilion border) has a more similar embryologic origin to skin and its etiology which is often based on ultraviolet (UV) exposure and is more similar to other nonmelanoma cancers.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anatomy - Primary Site(s)</td>
<td>Reference to dry vermilion lip has been removed from definition of oral cavity. Oral cavity extends from the portion of the lip that contacts the opposed lip (wet mucosa) to the junction of the hard and soft palate above, to the line of circumvallate papillae below, and to the anterior tonsillar pillars laterally.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anatomy - Primary Site(s)</td>
<td>Reference to dry vermilion lip has been removed from definition of mucosal lip. The mucosal lip begins at the junction of the wet and dry mucosa of the lip (the anterior border of the portion of the lip that comes into contact with the opposed lip) and extends posteriorly into the oral cavity to the attached gingiva of the alveolar ridge.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anatomy - Primary Site(s)</td>
<td>Occult Primary Tumor: Staging of the patient who presents with EBV- unrelated and HPV-unrelated metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy is not included in this chapter.</td>
<td>III</td>
