Approximately 55 % of all mucosal melanomas (MMs) arise
in the head and neck region. This disease represents less than
1 % of all melanomas.1 MM is an aggressive neoplasm that
exhibits unique features relative to other paranasal sinus and
head and neck malignancies, as well as features distinct from
cutaneous melanoma. Approximately two thirds of these
lesions arise in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, one
quarter are found in the oral cavity, and the remainder occur
sporadically in other mucosal sites of the head and neck.  
MM is an aggressive neoplasm with staging introduced in
the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer
Staging Manual, 7th Edition for separate consideration from
other mucosal-based lesions. The utility of this new system
has been confirmed.2-5  
The staging system of Ballantyne showed its utility and
emerged as the first staging system utilized specifically for
MM.6 The TNM system for paranasal sinus cancer was
not designed for and did not discriminate differences in
prognosis between the various stages in MM. It also did not
provide a staging system for MMs of the other potential sites
where disease arose in the head and neck. Therefore, in the
7th Edition, AJCC and the Union for International Cancer
Control (UICC) adopted a novel system for MM using only
T3, T4a, and T4b categories to characterize the local extent
of disease. The lack of clear discrimination in outcomes
based on the number and size of nodal metastases resulted
in adopting a dichotomous categorization of NO versus N+.
Thus, the four stages of disease for MM are represented by
III, IVA, IVB, and IVC. The system omits T1 and T2 catego-
ries, justified by the overall poor prognosis for even small
superficial lesions. Stratification into these stages assists the
clinician in treatment decision making. In Stage III disease,
the role of radiation still is not completely certain, but should
be strongly considered according to National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations; in Stage IVA,
local radiation is important and confers a survival benefit.7  
Stage IVB denotes extensive local invasion for which
treatment often is a nonsurgical approach for local palliation.

Stage IVC denotes distant metastatic disease.7 This stage
designation allows patients to understand their prognosis.
Furthermore, it provides a starting point for worldwide data
collection and analysis. At this time, key genetic mutations
such as BRAF are rarely seen in MM, thus making systemic
treatment with targeted agents problematic.1MMs occur throughout the mucosa of the upper aerodiges-
tive tract. For a description of anatomy, refer to the appropri-
ate anatomic site chapter based on the location of the mucosal
melanoma (e.g., paranasal sinus and oral cavity).  
MM originates from benign intramucosal melanocytes
that reside in the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract
(paranasal sinuses, oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx).  
There is no TO category for MM, because melanoma of
unknown primary is unlikely to arise from the mucosal sur-
faces and far more likely to arise from skin.The cervical nodes are the primary lymphatic drainage, and
those at risk are in the basin that corresponds to the anatomic
site where the tumor arises. Due to the rarity of the disease,
the role of nodal metastasis is confined to either present (N+)
or absent (NO). At this time, the role of extranodal extension
(ENE) is unknown and this modifier is not incorporated into
the system for MM.Distant metastases are common at some point in the course
of the disease. The most common sites are lung and liver.8MM tends to occur in older patients, as compared with cuta-
neous melanoma. MM can occur in any mucosal surface of
the head and neck. The majority arise, however, in the para-
nasal sinuses and nasal cavity, with the remainder primarily
in the oral cavity. Presenting symptoms depend on the tumor
site of origin. Nasal obstruction, bleeding, and a polypoid
mass are the most common symptoms. In the oral cavity, a
painless pigmented mass, often on the hard palate or alveolus
is the typical presenting finding.1 Up to 40% of head and  
neck MMs may be amelanotic. Nodal disease occurs in up to
15 % of patients with oral cavity MM.  
Clinical staging of MM is done through clinical
examination, appropriate imaging, and histological
confirmation of disease. Pathological staging is done after
surgical resection. Even small MMs behave aggressively, with
high rates of recurrence and death. Because even superficial
MMs exhibit this aggressive behavior, there is no T1 or T2
category in the MM staging system. Thus, primary cancers
limited to the mucosa and underlying soft tissue are considered
T3 lesions. Advanced MMs are classified as T4a and T4b. The
anatomic extent criteria to define moderately advanced (T4a)
and very advanced (T4b) disease are given below. In situ MMs
are extremely rare and are excluded from staging.
