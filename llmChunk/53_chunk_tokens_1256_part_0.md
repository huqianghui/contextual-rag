#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping  
##### p16 Testing  
p16 immunotesting is mandatory to use this staging system for HPV-associated cancer. HPV by in situ hybridization (ISH) may be done as an alternative. If a case of oropharyngeal cancer does not have p16 or HPV by ISH, then the case is staged by the p16- negative system (Chapter 11).

#### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined previously, the overall health of these patients clearly influences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using both tumor- and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer registrars to obtain important information regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to further hone the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions. AJCC Level of Evidence: III

#### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of additional medical illnesses.13 Accurate reporting of all illnesses in the patients' medical record is essential to assess these parameters. General performance measures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends that the clinician report performance status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Zubrod or Karnofsky performance measures, along with standard staging information. An interrelationship between each of the major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II
