When iodinated contrast is not employed for PET/CT, it also is difficult to evaluate for specific sites of disease involvement, which might upstage a tumor. For example, determining the presence of medial or lateral pterygoid muscle involvement (both T4) by a tonsillar carcinoma is difficult when relying on noncontrast large FOV CT for correlation with FDG-PET uptake.

Some subtleties of tumor involvement for staging also require clarification. The palatoglossus muscle forms the muscle bulk of the anterior tonsillar pillar and may be invaded with even a relatively small tonsillar or tonsillar pillar tumor. Although palatoglossus is defined as an extrinsic muscle of the tongue, involvement of this muscle within the oropharynx does not denote a significantly poorer prognosis for the patient and does not change the T category. A final imaging pitfall for consideration is during the imaging evaluation of a carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP). Most often, the small primary tumor is determined to be in the ipsilateral pharyngeal or lingual tonsil, but particularly with HPV-related tumors, it can be subtle and readily overlooked. It is important to evaluate carefully the CT or MR imaging for asymmetric size of ipsilateral tonsillar tissue and for heterogeneous tonsillar enhancement. PET/CT is an alternate modality if the lesion is not found on CT or MR images, and is best performed prior to oropharyngeal biopsies to avoid a false-positive FDG uptake.
