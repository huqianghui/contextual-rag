#### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse negatively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week and number of drinks per day will provide important data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss of >5% of body weight in the previous 6 months. 14 Depression adversely affects quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the medical record.15 AJCC Level of Evidence: III

#### Tobacco Use  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well established. However, exactly how this could be codified in the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard to apply accurately to the staging system. AJCC Level of Evidence: III Smoking history should be collected as an important element of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, \> 10 but ≤20 pack-years, or >20 pack-years.

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.16 Although this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medicine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore, the existing models that have been published or may be in clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by the
