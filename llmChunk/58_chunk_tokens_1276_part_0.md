The risk of regional nodal spread from cancers of the pharynx
is high. Oropharyngeal cancers usually involve upper and mid-
jugular lymph nodes and (less commonly) submental/subman-
dibular nodes. Base of tongue cancers often manifest bilateral
lymphatic drainage. Hypopharyngeal cancers spread to adja-
cent parapharyngeal, paratracheal, and mid- and lower jugular
nodes. Bilateral lymphatic drainage is common. In clinical

evaluation, the maximum size of the nodal mass should be
measured. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes.
Superior mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional
lymph nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to
describe the N category, regional lymph nodes should also be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
