Cancers of the oral cavity continue to represent a major prob-
lem worldwide. The American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition),
makes two significant changes based upon enhanced under-
standing of the behavior of these malignancies.  
The first modification is in T categorization incorporating
depth of invasion (DOI). It is important to recognize the dis-
tinction between tumor thickness and true DOI. It has been
recognized since the early work of Spiro and colleagues, in
the mid-1980s, that prognosis of oral cancers worsens as the
tumor grows thicker, similar to skin malignancies.4,5 The
somewhat more sophisticated measure of DOI has been an
oral cancer data element for collection in the National Cancer
Database by accredited Commission on Cancer hospitals
since the publication of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 6th
Edition in 2002. A detailed description of how DOI should be
measured is included in this chapter. It is important to under-
stand that the prognostic influence of DOI interacts with the
greatest diameter of the tumor and that DOI cannot be used in
isolation for assigning T category or for determining progno-
sis. A tumor less than or equal to 2 cm in greatest dimension  
may be categorized T2 based upon depth of invasion but such
a lesion does not become T3 as DOI increases, instead passing
directly to T4 with adjacent structure invasion. Similarly, a
lesion greater than 4 cm in greatest dimension but less than 10
mm in DOI will never be categorized T4 (despite its diameter)
unless it invades adjacent structures. Extrinsic muscle infiltra-
tion is no longer a staging criterion for T4 designation because
DOI supersedes it and extrinsic muscle invasion is difficult to
assess (clinically and pathologically). Pathologists should
perform tumor sampling which include sections that specifi-
cally assess DOI, resection margins, and tumor pattern of
invasion. DOI is measured from the reference point of closest
"normal" mucosal basement membrane. Resection margins
should be sampled perpendicular from each plane of margin,
to allow for measurements. Pattern of invasion should be sam-
pled specifically at the tumor/host interface. With respect to
DOI, the guiding principle, if there are doubts, is to select the
less ominous attribute (a lesser DOI) in a given case to avoid
stage migration (according to the so-called uncertain rule of
the AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)
TNM, as defined in Chapter 1).  
A second significant change is in the use of extranodal
extension (ENE) in categorizing metastatic cancer to neck
nodes. Any clinical ENE(+) will be designated cN3b.
Pathological ENE(+) will increase pN category by one full
category (from pN1 to pN2 or from pN2 to pN3). The effect
of ENE on prognosis in head and neck cancers is profound,
except for those tumors associated with HPV.5 Including this
important prognostic feature was considered critical in revis-
ing staging. Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse
prognostic factor is based on histopathological characteriza-
tion of ENE, especially the distinction between microscopic
and macroscopic ENE.6-8 Only unquestionable ENE is to be
used for clinical staging (as in the uncertain rule above). For
clinical ENE, the known limitations of current imaging
modalities to define ENE accurately demand that stringent
criteria be met prior to assigning a clinical diagnosis of ENE.
Only unambiguous evidence of gross ENE on clinical exam-
ination (e.g., multiple matted nodes, invasion of skin, infil-
tration of musculature/dense tethering to adjacent structures,
or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or
phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) supported by
strong radiographic evidence permits classification of dis-
ease as ENE(+). Pathological ENE also will be clearly
defined as extension of metastatic tumor (present within the
confines of the lymph node, through the lymph node capsule
into the surrounding connective tissue, with or without asso-
ciated stromal reaction). Tissue sampling should be directed
at the capsule/lymph node interface. Multiple sections may
be necessary for large positive lymph nodes. Again if there is
doubt or uncertainty of the presence of ENE, the case should
be categorized as ENE(-).  
A staging system revision should address and respond to
new information that influences patient outcome. An appro-
priate balance between complexity and utility (ease-of-use)

is necessary for universal acceptance. The TNM system for
oral cancers has strongly predicted prognosis and is applied
worldwide. The introduction of two new parameters in oral
cavity staging, DOI and ENE, better fits the prognostic mod-
eling from large datasets. However, it must be balanced by
the ability to derive accurate information from clinicians car-
ing for patients with head and neck cancer in many different
environments. Therefore, thorough descriptions of ENE and
DOI are included in this chapter.
