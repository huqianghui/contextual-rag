PET/MR imaging is an emerging modality; currently, there are few sites where these scanners are available for clinical imaging. MR images of the primary tumor and nodes and measurements of FDG activity are obtained simultaneously, resulting in fused PET/MR images. There presently is little literature on PET/MR imaging for head and neck tumors and none yet demonstrating increased accuracy of PET/MR imaging over PET/CT for the staging, follow-up, or surveillance of head and neck tumors. There is reduced ionizing radiation to the patient with PET/MR imaging as compared to PET/CT.
