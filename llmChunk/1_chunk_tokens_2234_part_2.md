To increase the utility of staging and acknowledge the emergence of a distinct disease, the p16+ and p16- OPCs are now separately described. OPC with p16 expression of weak intensity or limited distribution (<75% of cells) should be staged using oropharyngeal carcinoma p16- guidelines.
The 8th Edition TNM staging system for HPV-related cancers of the oropharynx provides better discrimination between stages. T categories remain the same for both p16+ and p16-, except that the p16+ classification includes no Tis category and no T4b, and p16- oropharynx, like other non-HPV associated cancers in the head and neck, includes no TO category.
The p16+ clinical TNM classification is applicable to all cases before treatment (both surgically and non-surgically treated cases). The pathological classification is confined to cases managed with surgery (following examination of the resected specimens, as with all other pathologically staged tumors).
A unique and potentially perplexing feature of pathological staging in HPV+ is that in the data set, pN3 category behaves as Stage I while pN2 behaves as Stage II. This finding is unprecedented, and only prospective collection of data will help clarify this apparent paradox.
