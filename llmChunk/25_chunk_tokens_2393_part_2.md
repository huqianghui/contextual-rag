<figcaption>Fig. 7.5 Depth of invasion (DOI). The horizon is established at the level of the basement membrane relative to the closest intact squamous mucosa. The greatest DOI is measured by dropping a "plumb line" from the horizon</figcaption>

<figcaption>Fig. 7.7 "WPOI-5" describes a dispersed tumor pattern of invasion which is significantly predictive of worst outcome. Carcinomas are classifiable as WPOI-5 when satellite dispersion is â‰¥ 1 mm from neighboring satellites. (a) Low-power overview demonstrating a context of generalized tumor dispersion. Tumor dispersion is measured at the advancing tumor edge. Carcinoma satellites in the green box are shown in panel (b), lower edge. The green line measures dispersion of almost 2 mm. (c) This carcinoma reveals only few dispersed satellites fulfilling this criteria, likely due to extratumoral lymphovascular emboli</figcaption>
