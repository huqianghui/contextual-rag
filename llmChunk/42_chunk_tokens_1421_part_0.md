#### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors, the overall
health of these patients clearly influences outcome. An ongo-
ing effort to better assess prognosis using both tumor and
nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart abstraction will
continue to be performed by cancer registrars to obtain
important information regarding specific factors related to
prognosis. These data will then be used to further hone the
predictive power of the staging system in future revisions.

#### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all illnesses in
the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful

in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends that
the clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures, along with standard staging informa-
tion. An interrelationship between each of the major perfor-
mance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II
