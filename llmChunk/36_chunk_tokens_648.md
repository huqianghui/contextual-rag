10\. Depression diagnosisThere is no uniform grading system for salivary gland.The exact classification of salivary tumors can be challeng-
ing, especially in limited material, given the potential for
phenotypic overlap.14 The histology table in this chapter
reflects the 2017 World Health Organization classification of
salivary malignancies. Some tumors are routinely graded by
three-tiered schema, some by two-tiered schema, some may
develop a "dedifferentiated" or abrupt high-grade transfor-
mation, and others are not graded. Ductal carcinomas are
modified by the presence or absence of invasion plus grade.
The additional criteria of "minimally invasive" is a modifier
for carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.
