No
imaging study can currently identify minor ENE in meta-
static nodes, microscopic foci of cancer in regional nodes or
distinguish between small reactive nodes and small nodes
with metastatic deposits (in the absence of central radio-
graphic inhomogeneity).  
#### Pathological Classification  
Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional lymph
node dissections, followed by pathological examination of
the resection specimen allows for the use of this designation
for pT and/or pN, respectively. Resections after radiation or  
chemotherapy should be identified and considered in con-
text. pT is derived from the actual measurement of the
unfixed tumor in the surgical specimen. It should be noted,
however, that up to 30% shrinkage of soft tissues may occur
in resected specimen after formalin fixation. Pathological
staging represents additional and important information and
should be included as such in staging, but it does not sup-
plant clinical staging as the primary staging scheme.
Metastasis found on imaging is considered cM1. Biopsy-
proven metastasis is considered pM1.  
#### Pathological assessment of the primary tumor  
Specimen prosection must separately address three issues:
DOI, resection margins, and WPOI; it is best to submit differ-
ent tissue cassettes documenting each prognosticator.
