Tumors may obstruct the frontal recess or sphenoethmoidal recess, which may result in obstruction of the frontal or sphenoid sinus, respectively. Differential between tumor extension and proteinaceous obstructed secretions is best performed with MR imaging, which will help accurately identify T4a tumors. Both CT and MR imaging may be used to evaluate for posterior spread to the pterygopalantine fossa. However, MR imaging is superior to CT for evaluating for retrograde perineural spread along V2 through foramen rotundum or V3.

CT is superior to MR imaging for early cortical involvement, but MR imaging is superior to CT for bone marrow invasion. MR imaging also is superior to CT for identifying dural involvement or other types of intracranial extension (T4b).

##### Pathological Classification
Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional nodal dissections, followed by pathological examination of the resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation for pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected after radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and considered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived from the invasion of bone, orbit, dura, and presence of disease in multiple subsites. Pathological staging represents additional and important information and should be included as such in

staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as the primary staging scheme.

For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include 10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph nodes. Negative pathological examination of a smaller number of nodes still mandates a pNO designation.

##### Definition of ENE and Description of Its Extent
All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined for the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of ENE has varied in the literature over the course of time. The American College of Pathologists defines ENE as extension of metastatic tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.

ENE detected on histopathologic examination is designated as ENEmi (microscopic ENE â‰¤2mm) or ENEma (major ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be required for current pN definition, but data collection is recommended to allow standardization of data collection and future analysis.

#### PROGNOSTIC FACTORS
##### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping
Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.

##### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care
###### Extranodal Extension (ENE)
ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present beyond the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE extension (i.e., defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE(+). AJCC Level of Evidence: III

###### Overall Health
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer registrars to obtain important information regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to further hone the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions.
