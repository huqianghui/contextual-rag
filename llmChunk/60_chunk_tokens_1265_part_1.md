ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE (i.e., defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE(+). AJCC Level of Evidence: III

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined previously, the overall health of these patients clearly influences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer registrars to obtain important information regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to further hone the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of additional medical illnesses.ยนยบ Accurate reporting of all illnesses in the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of these parameters. General performance measures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the clinician report performance status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance measures along with standard staging information. An interrelationship between each of the major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II
