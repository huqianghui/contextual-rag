#### Extranodal Extension  
ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or

<!-- PageHeader="8 Major Salivary Glands" -->  
without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE (defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk
or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a sufficiently
high threshold to classify these tumors as clinical ENE(+).
AJCC Level of Evidence: III  
#### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influ-
ences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess progno-
sis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is
underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed
by cancer registrars to obtain important information
regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These data
then will be used to further hone the predictive power of
the staging system in future revisions. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
#### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.1º Accurate reporting of all ill-
nesses in the patient's medical record is essential to
assessment of these parameters. General performance mea-
sures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly
recommends the clinician report performance status using
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod,
or Karnofsky performance measures, along with standard
staging information. An interrelationship between each of
the major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of
Evidence: II

#### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be measured indirectly by weight loss of>5% of body  
weight in the previous 6 months.11 Depression adversely
affects quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.12 AJCC Level of Evidence: III  
#### Tobacco Use  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. Exactly how this could be codified in the staging
system, however, is less clear. At this time, smoking is known
to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is difficult to
accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important
element of the demographics and may be included in
Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the mini-
mum standard should classify smoking history as never, ≤
10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack years.
