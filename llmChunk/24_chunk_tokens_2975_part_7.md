DOI is
assessed relative to adjacent normal mucosa. If carcinoma
invades medullary bone, or subcutaneous tissues on gross
examination, then it is categorized as T4 and DOI become
irrelevant. The basic principle of resection margin assessment
is that each tissue plane that meets the surgeon (bone, mucosa,
soft tissue, vessels, and nerve) represents a resection margin
and requires evaluation. Each specimen can be thought of as a
multi-planed manifold; each cut surface from each orthogonal
plane represents a margin surface. Ideally, margin assessment
is performed as a comprehensive intraoperative process. Avoid
parallel shave margins for mucosal/soft tissue assessment. The
pitfall with shave margins is that they may be negative, but if
on permanent sections cancer is present on deeper sections,
the opportunity for measurements is lost. In the context of
intraoperative assessment, the mucosal and soft tissue margins
should be processed first, as these are actionable steps. Then
process further tissue sections deliberately aimed to assess
DOI and WPOI. WPOI sections are harvested from the tumor
advancing edge at the soft tissue interface.  
#### Pathological assessment of ENE  
Resected positive lymph nodes require examination for the
presence and extent of ENE. ENEmi is defined as microscopic
ENE â‰¤2 mm.
