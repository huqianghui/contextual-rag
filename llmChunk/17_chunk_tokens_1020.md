Notes:  
1\. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes  
2\. ENE detected on histopathologic examination is designated as
ENEmi (microscopic ENE â‰¤2mm) or  
ENEma (major ENE>2mm)  
Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for definition of pN.  
Note: A designation of "U" or "L" may be used for any N category to
indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (U) or below
the lower border of the cricoid (L)  
Similarly, clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as ENE(-)
or ENE(+)Prognostic Stage Groups for metastatic cervical adenopathy
and unknown primary tumor except for EBV-related and
HPV-related tumors.
