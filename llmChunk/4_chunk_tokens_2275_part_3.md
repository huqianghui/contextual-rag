When enlarged lymph nodes are detected, the actual size (measured as the maximum dimension in any direction) of the nodal mass(es) should be recorded. Pathological examination is necessary for documentation of tumor extent in terms of the location or level of the lymph node(s) involved and the number of nodes that contain metastases. The pathological presence or absence of ENE should be designated as ENE(+) or ENE(-).
