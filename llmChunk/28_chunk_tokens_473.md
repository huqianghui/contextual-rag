<figcaption>Fig. 7.11 T4a is defined as moderately advanced local disease, tumor invading adjacent structures only (e.g., through cortical bone of the
mandible or maxilla, or involves the maxillary sinus or skin of face) or greater than 4 cm with DOI greater than 10 millimeters. DOI is depth of
invasion and not tumor thickness Fig. 7.12 T4b is defined as very advanced local disease, tumor
involves masticator space, pterygoid plates (as shown), or skull base
and/or encases internal carotid artery</figcaption>
