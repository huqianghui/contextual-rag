#### INTRODUCTION
Malignancies that arise in the epithelial lining of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity, with the exception of lymphoma and sarcoma, are staged according to this system. Many histologic subtypes exist and also are a factor in determining prognosis.4 T category is identical to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition). As in other head and neck sites, the N category has been expanded to incorporate extranodal extension (ENE).5

The role of ENE in prognosis of head and neck cancers is profound. Accounting for this important prognostic feature was considered critical in revising staging. Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse prognostic factor are based on histopathological characterization of ENE, especially the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic or gross ENE.3,6,7 As per the "uncertain rule" of the AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging, which mandates that the lower category should always be assigned in ambiguous cases, a case should be categorized as ENE(-) unless there is unquestionable ENE. For clinical ENE, the known inability of current imaging modalities to define ENE accurately mandated that stringent criteria be met prior to assigning a clinical diagnosis of ENE.8 However, unambiguous evidence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion of skin, infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adjacent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) supported by strong radiographic evidence permit classification of disease as ENE(+). Pathological ENE also will be clearly defined in this chapter. Again, if there is doubt or uncertainty of the presence of ENE, the case should be categorized as ENE(-).

Cancer of the maxillary sinus is the most common of the sinonasal malignancies. Ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity cancers are equal in frequency, but considerably less common than maxillary sinus cancers. Tumors of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are rare.

#### ANATOMY
##### Primary Site(s)
The location and the extent of the mucosal lesion within the maxillary sinus have prognostic significance. Historically, a plane connecting the medial canthus of the eye to the angle of the mandible, represented by Ohngren's line, is used to divide the maxillary sinus into an anteroinferior portion (infrastructure), which is associated with a good prognosis, and a posterosuperior portion (suprastructure), which has a poor prognosis (Fig. 12.1). The poorer outcome associated with suprastructure cancers reflects early invasion by these tumors to critical structures, including the orbit, skull base, pterygoid plates, and infratemporal fossa.
