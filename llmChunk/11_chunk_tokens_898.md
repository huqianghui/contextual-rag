The presence of cervical lymph node metastases is the most
important adverse prognostic feature for most cancers of the
head and neck. However, the degree of impact on prognosis
varies depending on host and tumor characteristics such as
interplay of Human Papilloma Virus-initiation and smoking sta-
tus in cancers of the oropharynx, and the presence of extranodal
extension (ENE) for most other sites. The natural history and
response to treatment of cervical nodal metastases from Epstein-
Barr virus-associated nasopharynx (EBV-related) and HPV-
related oropharynx primary sites are different in terms of their
impact on prognosis, so they warrant separate N classification
schemes. This difference also has led to reclassification of the
TO category (occult primary tumor) based on the EBV and HPV
status of the metastatic cervical nodes. Current understanding of
other nodal features-such as the size of the largest metastatic
node, number of metastatic nodes, and laterality-has improved
based on an analysis of large multi-institutional datasets for oral
cavity cancer. The American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition)
incorporates these data while striving to maintain the balance
between increased complexity and ease of use.  
Two major changes are instituted in the 8th Edition for
staging cervical nodal metastasis.  
1\. For the first time, different clinical and pathological N
classifications are proposed for definition of regional
lymph node metastasis. This breaks with tradition in
head and neck cancer, although distinct clinical and
pathological classifications have been promulgated for
other tumor sites (e.g., breast cancer). It is helpful to
consider that clinical TNM (cTNM) and pathological
TNM (pTNM) have different purposes. cTNM classi-
fication is required for all patients, including those
undergoing surgery. pTNM classification provides
additional information, but only for patients undergo-
ing surgery; this guides the use of adjuvant treatment
based on factors that become available after histopath-
ological examination of the specimen (e.g., high-risk
features of the primary site, ENE, laterality, and vol-
ume of metastatic nodal disease).  
2\. A second significant change is in the use of ENE in
categorizing metastatic cancer to neck nodes. The

effect of ENE in prognosis in head and neck cancers
is profound, except for those tumors associated with
HPV. Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse
prognostic factor is based on histopathological char-
acterization of ENE, especially the distinction
between microscopic and macroscopic ENE. Only
unquestionable clinically evident ENE that is sup-
ported by radiological evidence is to be used for
clinical staging. The guiding principle is to assign
the lesser attribute (ENE negative) if there are doubts
in a particular case to avoid stage migration, in
accordance with the uncertain rule, which articulates
the concept that whenever there is a question, the
lesser stage should be chosen. For clinical ENE, the
known limitations of current imaging modalities to
define ENE accurately demand that stringent criteria
be met prior to assigning a clinical diagnosis of ENE
if the patient is treated with nonsurgical therapy for
neck metastasis. However, unambiguous evidence of
gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion of
skin, infiltration of musculature, dense tethering or
fixation to adjacent structures, or cranial nerve, bra-
chial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve
invasion with dysfunction) supported by strong
radiographic evidence permits classification of dis-
ease as ENEc. Pathological ENE also will be clearly
defined as extension of metastatic tumor (beyond the
confines of the lymph node, through the lymph node
capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with
or without associated stromal reaction). Again when
there is doubt, recall the uncertain rule and assign a
lower stage.
