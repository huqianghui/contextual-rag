###### Comorbidity
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of additional medical illnesses.9 Accurate reporting of all illnesses in the patient's medical record is essential to the assessment of these parameters. General performance measures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the clinician report performance status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance measures, along with standard staging information. An interrelationship between each of the major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: III

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">Zubrod/ECOG Performance Scale</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>Fully active, able to carry out all predisease activities without restriction (Karnofsky 90-100)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature. For example, light housework, office work (Karnofsky 70-80)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50 % of waking hours (Karnofsky 50-60)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours (Karnofsky 30-40)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Completely disabled. Cannot carry out self-care. Totally confined to bed (Karnofsky 10-20)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Death (Karnofsky 0)</td>

###### Lifestyle Factors
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse negatively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week and number of drinks per day will provide important data for future analysis.

Nutrition is important to prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss of>5% of body weight in the previous 6 months.10 Depression adversely impacts quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the medical record.11 AJCC Level of Evidence: III

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well established. However, exactly how this could be codified in the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard to accurately apply to the staging system.
