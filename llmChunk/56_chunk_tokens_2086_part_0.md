#### Cancers Staged Using This Staging System  
p16 negative (p16-) squamous cancers of the oropharynx; oropharyngeal cancers without a p16 immunostain performed;
and all cancers of the hypopharynx. Minor salivary cancers and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the oropharynx and hypo-
pharynx. p16 assessment is necessary only for squamous carcinomas. Typically, p16-negative squamous carcinomas are
keratinizing.
