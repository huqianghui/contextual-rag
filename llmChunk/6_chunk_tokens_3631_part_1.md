These new N criteria were then validated using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-Princess Margaret Hospital (MSKCC-PMH) institutional data set (Fig. 5.4 and Table 5.5).

After validation of the N criteria, the next step was to examine the interplay of these new T and N criteria for stage grouping. The NCDB data could not be used for this purpose because of the lack of information on depth of information of the primary tumor. The MSKCC-PMH data set was therefore used for stage group analysis using 7th Edition AJCC/UICC criteria (Fig. 5.5 and Table 5.6).

As seen in Fig. 5.5, the 7th Edition stage groupings were unable to discriminate between Stage II and Stage III, an effect that may largely be attributable to the redistribution of prognostic weight introduced by the addition of DOI and the relatively lower prognostic impact of low-volume nodal metastatic disease, especially with the addition of adjuvant treatment. In recognition of these newer prognostic factors, the MSKCC-PMH data were re-interrogated after appropriate adjustment of the stage groups, resulting in better discrimination of stage groups (Fig. 5.6 and Table 5.7).

However, these stage groupings could not be validated on cancer registry data because comparable data on DOI of the primary tumor and ENE were not recorded for 7th Edition AJCC/UICC staging. Therefore, although institutional data that support restructuring stage groups for oral cavity cancer exist, the stage groupings will remain unchanged pending future validation.
