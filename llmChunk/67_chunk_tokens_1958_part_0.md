The predominant cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The
staging guidelines are applicable to all forms of carcinoma,
including those arising from minor salivary glands. Other
nonepithelial tumors such as those of lymphoid tissue, soft
tissue, bone, and cartilage (i.e., lymphoma and sarcoma) are
not included. Histologic confirmation of diagnosis is
required. Histopathologic grading of squamous carcinoma is
recommended. The grade is subjective and uses a descrip-
tive, as well as numerical, form (i.e., well differentiated,
moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated),
depending on the degree of closeness to or deviation from
squamous epithelium in mucosal sites. Also recommended
where feasible is a quantitative evaluation of depth of inva-
sion of the primary tumor and the presence or absence of
vascular invasion and perineural invasion. Although the
grade of tumor does not enter into the staging of the tumor, it
should be recorded. The pathological description of any
lymphadenectomy specimen should describe the size, num-
ber, and position of the involved node(s) and the presence or
absence of ENE.
