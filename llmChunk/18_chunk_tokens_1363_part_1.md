Up-to-date cancer registry data on the influence of the new N criteria on outcomes are not available because ENE is only now being introduced into the nodal staging system. Limited data are available, however, from the NCDB for patients treated in 2010-11 for squamous cell carcinoma at sites other than nasopharynx and HPV-related oropharynx cancer (Fig. 6.5). The proposed new N classification was then validated in a large dataset of patients with oral cancer treated at two tertiary cancer care centers in North America. (Fig. 6.6 and Table 6.3).
