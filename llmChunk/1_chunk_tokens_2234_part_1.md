The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition) TNM staging of OPC tumors lacks hazard discrimination, hazard consistency, and capacity to predict outcome. HR-HPV associated cancers occur more often in younger, healthier individuals with little or no tobacco exposure. HPV16/18 are the most commonly detected transcriptionally active HR-HPV types. The established staging criteria defined in the 7th Edition are insufficient to adequately stage and define the biology of this emerging disease. Immunohistochemistry for p16 overexpression has emerged as a robust surrogate biomarker for HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and as an independent positive prognosticator in this specific context. Direct detection of HPV is not used as a defining factor due to limited availability of the test, cost, and lack of additional ability to predict survival compared with p16 overexpression. It is important to remind clinicians, however, that p16 overexpression is context-specific and currently applicable only to the tonsillar and base of tongue regions of the oropharynx. Designation of p16 overexpression should occur only when there is significant staining following established criteria.
