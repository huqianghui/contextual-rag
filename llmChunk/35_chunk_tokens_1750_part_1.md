#### Definition of Regional Lymph Node (N)  
##### Clinical N (CN)  

| N Category | N Criteria |
|------------|------------|
| NX         | Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed |
| NO         | No regional lymph node metastasis |
| N1 N2      | Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
|            | Metastasis in a single ipsilateral node larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-); or metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-); or in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N2a        | Metastasis in a single ipsilateral node larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N2b        | Metastases in multiple ipsilateral nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N2c        | Metastases in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N3         | Metastasis in a lymph node larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-); or metastasis in any node(s) with clinically overt ENE(+) |
| N3a        | Metastasis in a lymph node larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N3b        | Metastases in any node(s) with clinically overt ENE(+) |

Note: A designation of "U" or "L" may be used for any N category to indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (U) or below the lower border of the cricoid (L)  
Similarly, clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as ENE(-) or ENE(+)  

##### Pathological N (pN)  

| N Category | N Criteria |
|------------|------------|
| NX         | Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed |
| NO         | No regional lymph node metastasis |
| N1         | Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N2         | Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension and ENE(+); or larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-); or metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph node(s), none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-); or in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N2a        | Metastasis in single ipsilateral node 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension and ENE(+) or a single ipsilateral node larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
| N2b        | Metastases in multiple ipsilateral nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE(-) |
