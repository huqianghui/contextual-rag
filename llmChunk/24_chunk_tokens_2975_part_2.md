Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is primarily done
for nodal staging of disease or when distant metastases are
suspected, unless the CT component is performed as a post-
contrast examination with dedicated neck imaging.
Ultrasound does not allow adequate evaluation of the oral
cavity primary tumor site, but it may be a useful adjunct for
estimating DOI and for nodal evaluation with otherwise
equivocal nodal imaging findings.  
As small but clinically evident mucosal tumors may be
subtle on imaging, it is important to review the imaging
exam with knowledge of the tumor site. T1, T2, and T3
tumors are distinguished only by size and depth of invasion.
The former is better determined by clinical examination,
although a radiologic measurement should be given as part
of the imaging report. The radiologist's more important role
during tumor staging is to determine deep tissue involve-
ment and assess for nodal and/or distant metastases. T4 dis-
ease entails invasion into adjacent bone, sinus or skin or else
large transverse size (> 4 cm) and greater than 10 mm DOI,
which varies according to the specific subsite of the oral
cavity. For alveolar ridge, floor of mouth, retromolar trian-
gle, hard palate, and large lip tumors, careful attention
should be paid to the cortex and marrow space of the adja-
cent maxilla or mandible, because such invasion denotes

T4a disease. In the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th
Edition, oral tongue tumors were designated T4a when there
was deep invasion into the extrinsic muscles of the tongue
and/or the floor of the mouth. DOI supersedes muscle inva-
sion in the 8th Edition. Depth is frequently better evaluated
in the coronal plane and/or sagittal plane. More posterior
extensive spread of tumor-such as buccal tumors invading
into the muscles of mastication, or spreading to the ptery-
goid plates or superiorly to the skull base-denotes T4b
tumor. Additionally, posterolateral tumor spread to surround
the internal carotid artery is also T4b disease.
