The epidemic of HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancer and its
significantly different behavior and natural history has resulted
in the need to develop two different staging systems for oro-
pharynx cancer: one for HPV-positive and another for HPV-
negative cancers.45 Historically, the pharynx was covered in a
single chapter, but in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th
Edition (8th Edition), the recognition of the unique nature of
the two virally mediated diseases of the nasopharynx and
oropharynx have resulted in dividing one chapter into three.
This chapter deals with p16- oropharyngeal cancers and all
mucosally based hypopharyngeal cancers. The staging of
these two sites will be similar to the AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition), with the exception of the N
category and the removal of TO. TO will be used only when a
node is p16+, and therefore staged in the HPV-associated oro-
pharynx chapter, EBV-associated and staged in the nasophar-
ynx chapter, or staged in the cervical node chapter. ENE has
such a profound effect on outcome that it has been incorpo-
rated into the determination of N.6  
The effect of ENE on prognosis of head and neck cancers
not caused by HPV is profound. Accounting for this impor-
tant prognostic feature was considered critical in revising
staging. ENE will increase the pathological nodal category by
1 (as described in the section "Definitions of AJCC TNM").  
Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse prognostic
factor is based on histopathological characterization of ENE,
especially the distinction between microscopic and macro-
scopic ENE.3,7,8 Therefore, only unquestionable ENE is to be
used for clinical staging. As per the "uncertain rule" of the
AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging,
which mandates that the lower category should always be

<!-- PageNumber="125" -->  
assigned in ambiguous cases, a case should be categorized as
ENE(-) unless there is unquestionable ENE. For clinical ENE,
the known inability of current imaging modalities to define
ENE accurately mandated that stringent criteria are met prior to
assigning a clinical diagnosis of ENE.9 However, unambiguous
evidence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion
of skin; infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adjacent
structures; or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk,
or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) supported by
strong radiographic evidence permit classification of disease as
ENE(+). Pathological ENE also will be clearly defined below.
Again, if there is doubt or uncertainty of the presence of ENE,
the case should be categorized as ENE(-).  
TNM staging of cancers of the oropharynx not associated
with HPV and cancers of the hypopharynx is critical to under-
standing their natural history. The stage groupings provide
stratification for prognosis that is valuable to the clinician and
the individual patient. Taking the p16+, HPV-mediated can-
cers out of this staging increases its utility and accuracy.Cancers arise in the mucosa of the oropharynx and hypo-
pharynx (Fig.11.1). They invade into neighboring structures
as they advance.The oropharynx is the portion of the continuity of the pharynx
extending from the plane of the superior surface of the soft
palate to the superior surface of the hyoid bone (or vallecula).
It includes the base of the tongue, the inferior (anterior) sur-  
face of the soft palate and the uvula, the anterior and posterior
tonsillar pillars, the glossotonsillar sulci, the pharyngeal ton-
sils, and the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls.The hypopharynx is that portion of the pharynx extending
from the plane of the superior border of the hyoid bone (or
vallecula) to the plane corresponding to the lower border of
the cricoid cartilage. It includes the pyriform sinuses (right
and left), the lateral and posterior hypopharyngeal walls, and
the postcricoid region. The postcricoid area extends from the
level of the arytenoid cartilages and connecting folds to the
plane of the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. It con-
nects the two pyriform sinuses, thus forming the anterior
wall of the hypopharynx. The pyriform sinus extends from
the pharyngoepiglottic fold to the upper end of the esopha-
gus at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and is bounded
laterally by the lateral pharyngeal wall and medially by the
lateral surface of the aryepiglottic fold and the arytenoid and
cricoid cartilages. The posterior pharyngeal wall extends
from the level of the superior surface of the hyoid bone (or
vallecula) to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage and
from the apex of one pyriform sinus to the other.
