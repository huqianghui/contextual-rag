Pathological staging requires the use of all information
obtained in clinical staging and in histologic study of the sur-
gically resected specimen. The surgeon's evaluation of gross
unresected residual tumor also must be included.  
Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional
nodal dissections, followed by pathological examination of
the resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation
for pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected
after radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and
considered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived
from the actual measurement of the unfixed tumor in the sur-
gical specimen. It should be noted, however, that up to 30 %
shrinkage of soft tissues may occur in resected specimen
after formalin fixation. Pathological staging represents addi-
tional and important information and should be included as
such in staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as
the primary staging scheme.  
Histopathologic grading of squamous carcinoma is rec-
ommended. The grade is subjective and uses a descriptive, as
well as a numerical, form (i.e., well differentiated, moder-
ately differentiated, and poorly differentiated), depending on
the degree of closeness to or deviation from squamous epi-
thelium in mucosal sites. Also recommended, where feasi-
ble, is a quantitative evaluation of depth of invasion of the
primary tumor and the presence or absence of vascular inva-
sion and perineural invasion. Although the grade of tumor  
does not enter into the staging of the tumor, it should be
recorded.  
The pathological description of any lymphadenectomy
specimen should describe the size, number, and location/
level of the involved node(s) and the presence or absence
of ENE. For pN, a selective neck dissection ordinarily
will include 10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or
modified radical neck dissection ordinarily will include
15 or more lymph nodes. Negative pathological examina-
tion of a smaller number of nodes still mandates a pNO
designation.All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined
for the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of
ENE also has varied in the literature over time. The American
College of Pathologists defines ENE as extension of meta-
static tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding con-
nective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.
Pathological examination is necessary for documentation of
such disease extent.  
ENE detected on histopathologic examination is desig-
nated as ENEmi (microscopic ENEâ‰¤2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be
required for current pN definition, but data collection is rec-
ommended to allow standardization of data collection and
future analysis.Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories,
no additional prognostic factors are required for stage
grouping.In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of these patients clearly influ-
ences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis
using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway.
Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer
registrars to obtain important information regarding specific
factors related to prognosis. These data then will be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions.

<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE (i.e., defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, or invasion of cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve with dysfunction) is a
sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE+.
