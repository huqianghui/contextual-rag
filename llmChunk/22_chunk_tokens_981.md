The oral cavity extends from the portion of the lip that con-
tacts the opposed lip (wet mucosa) to the junction of the hard
and soft palate above, to the line of circumvallate papillae  
below, and to the anterior tonsillar pillars laterally. It is addi-
tionally divided into multiple specific sites listed below
(Figs. 7.1-7.3).The mucosal lip begins at the junction of the wet and dry
mucosa of the lip (the anterior border of the portion of the lip
that comes into contact with the opposed lip) and extends
posteriorly into the oral cavity to the attached gingiva of the
alveolar ridge. The dry vermilion lip and vermilion border is
staged using the chapter on cutaneous carcinoma of the head
and neck (Chapter 15). This is a change from past AJCC edi-
tions where the dry vermilion was included in the lip and oral
cavity chapter.The buccal mucosa includes all the mucous membrane lining
of the inner surface of the cheeks and lips from the line of

contact of the opposing lips to the line of attachment of
mucosa of the alveolar ridge (upper and lower) and pterygo-
mandibular raphe.The lower alveolar ridge refers to the mucosa overlying the
alveolar process of the mandible, which extends from the
line of attachment of mucosa in the lower gingivobuccal sul-
cus to the line of attachment of free mucosa of the floor of
the mouth. Posteriorly, it extends to the ascending ramus of
the mandible.The upper alveolar ridge refers to the mucosa overlying the
alveolar process of the maxilla, which extends from the line
of attachment of mucosa in the upper gingivobuccal sulcus to
the junction of the hard palate. Its posterior margin is the
upper end of the pterygopalatine arch.The retromolar gingiva, or retromolar trigone, is the attached
mucosa overlying the ascending ramus of the mandible from
the level of the posterior surface of the last lower molar tooth
to the apex superiorly, adjacent to the tuberosity of the
maxilla.The floor of the mouth is a crescentic surface overlying the
mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles, extending from the
inner surface of the lower alveolar ridge to the undersurface
of the tongue. Its posterior boundary is the base of the ante-
rior pillar of the tonsil. It is divided into two sides by the
frenulum of the tongue and harbors the ostia of the subman-
dibular and sublingual salivary glands.The hard palate is the semilunar area between the upper alve-
olar ridge and the mucous membrane covering the palatine
process of the maxillary palatine bones. It extends from the
inner surface of the superior alveolar ridge to the posterior
edge of the palatine bone.The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is the freely mobile
portion of the tongue that extends anteriorly from the line
of circumvallate papillae to the undersurface of the tongue
at the junction with the floor of the mouth. It is composed
of four areas: the tip, the lateral borders, the dorsum, and
the undersurface (nonvillous ventral surface of the
tongue). The undersurface of the tongue is considered a
separate category by the World Health Organization
(WHO).
