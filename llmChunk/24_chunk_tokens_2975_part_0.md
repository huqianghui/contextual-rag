#### Clinical Classification  
Clinical staging for Oral Cavity cancers is predicated most
strongly upon the history and physical examination. Biopsy
is necessary to confirm diagnosis and is typically performed
on the primary. Nodal biopsy is done by fine needle aspira-
tion when indicated. Results from diagnostic biopsy of the
primary tumor, regional nodes, and distant metastases can be
included in clinical classification.  
Inspection of the oral cavity typically reveals the greatest
diameter of a cancer, though palpation is essential to assess
DOI and submucosal extension. The mucosal extent of the
cancer usually reflects its true linear dimension. Induration

surrounding a cancer typically is due to peritumoral inflam-
mation. DOI should be distinguished from tumor thickness,
and its determination is predicated on invasion beneath the
plane defined by surrounding normal mucosa. Any exophytic
character should be noted, but assignment of stage is deter-
mined by what transpires at or beneath the surface (defined by
adjacent normal mucosa). Clinical evidence of bone destruc-
tion should be noted and its depth estimated (e.g., into bone
versus through cortex into the marrow space). Thick lesions
often are defined by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging, but the difference between thick-
ness and DOI must be observed. Lesions located near the
midline more often involve the contralateral side of the neck
than well-lateralized cancers. Dysphagia is suggestive of a
tumor with sufficient invasion of oral structures to engender
dysfunction. It is seldom present when cancers have little
DOI. Similarly, drooling or the inability to swallow liquids
without difficulty suggests a tumor with substantial
DOI. Trismus, when not caused by pain, is consistent with a
deeply invasive lesion. Complaints of numbness of the lip
and/or teeth are commonly associated with nerve invasion.
Clinicians experienced with head and neck cancer will gener-
ally have few problems distinguishing less invasive lesions (≤
5 mm) from those of moderate depth (from > 5 to ≤ 10 mm)
or deeply invasive cancers (> 10 mm) through examination
alone. Such experts have estimated the maximum dimensions
for complicated lesions of the tonsil or palate for many years.
However, the distinction between 4 mm DOI and 6 mm DOI
(for example) may not be possible on clinical grounds. A
higher T category should be assigned on the basis of DOI
only if the differences in DOI are clear.
