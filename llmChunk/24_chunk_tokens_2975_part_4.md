#### Pathological Classification  
Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional lymph
node dissections, followed by pathological examination of
the resection specimen allows for the use of this designation
for pT and/or pN, respectively. Resections after radiation or  
chemotherapy should be identified and considered in con-
text. pT is derived from the actual measurement of the
unfixed tumor in the surgical specimen. It should be noted,
however, that up to 30% shrinkage of soft tissues may occur
in resected specimen after formalin fixation. Pathological
staging represents additional and important information and
should be included as such in staging, but it does not sup-
plant clinical staging as the primary staging scheme.
Metastasis found on imaging is considered cM1. Biopsy-
proven metastasis is considered pM1.  
#### Pathological assessment of the primary tumor  
Specimen prosection must separately address three issues:
DOI, resection margins, and WPOI; it is best to submit differ-
ent tissue cassettes documenting each prognosticator. DOI is
assessed relative to adjacent normal mucosa. If carcinoma
invades medullary bone, or subcutaneous tissues on gross
examination, then it is categorized as T4 and DOI become
irrelevant. The basic principle of resection margin assessment
is that each tissue plane that meets the surgeon (bone, mucosa,
soft tissue, vessels, and nerve) represents a resection margin
and requires evaluation. Each specimen can be thought of as a
multi-planed manifold; each cut surface from each orthogonal
plane represents a margin surface. Ideally, margin assessment
is performed as a comprehensive intraoperative process. Avoid
parallel shave margins for mucosal/soft tissue assessment.
