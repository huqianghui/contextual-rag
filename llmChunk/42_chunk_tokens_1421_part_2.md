#### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be indirectly measured by weight loss of>10% of body
weight. Depression adversely impacts quality of life and sur-
vival. Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depres-
sion should be recorded in the medical record. AJCC Level
of Evidence: III  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard to
accurately apply to the staging system. Smoking history
should be collected as an important element of the demo-
graphics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the
future. For practicality, the minimum standard should clas-
sify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤20
pack-years, or>20 pack-years.The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.32 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision
medicine, this work was published only very recently.
Therefore, the existing models that have been published or
may be in clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this
cancer site by the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In
the future, the statistical prediction models for this cancer
site will be evaluated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria
will be endorsed.
