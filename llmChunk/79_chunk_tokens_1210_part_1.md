<figcaption>sues with vocal cord fixation Fig. 13.9 T4a for the supraglottis is defined as
moderately advanced local disease, tumor invading
through the thyroid cartilage and/or invading tissues
beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of neck,
including deep extrinsic muscle of the tongue, strap
muscles, thyroid, or esophagus). Here, tumor has invaded
beyond the larynx into the vallecula and base of the
tongue, as well as into soft tissues of the neck</figcaption>

<figcaption>Fig. 13.11 T1 tumors of the glottis are limited to the vocal cord(s)
with normal mobility (may involve anterior or posterior commissure).
Tla tumors are limited to one vocal cord (top right) and T1b tumors
involve both vocal cords (bottom right) Fig. 13.13 T3 tumors of the glottis are limited to the larynx with vocal
cord fixation (shown), and/or invade paraglottic space and/or inner cor-
tex of the thyroid cartilage</figcaption>
