The pharynx is divided into three regions: nasopharynx, oro-
pharynx, and hypopharynx (Fig. 9.1). The specific anatomic
site of nasopharynx and regional lymphatics are described in
this section.  
The nasopharynx begins anteriorly at the posterior cho-
ana and extends along the plane of the airway to the level of
the free border of the soft palate. It includes the superior
wall, the posterior wall, and the lateral walls, which include  
the fossae of Rosenmuller and the mucosa covering the torus
tubaris forming the Eustachian tube orifice. The floor is the
superior surface of the soft palate. The posterior margins of
the choanal orifices and of the nasal septum are included in
the nasal fossa.  
Nasopharyngeal tumors extending to the nasal cavity or
oropharynx in the absence of parapharyngeal space involve-
ment do not have a significantly worse outcome than tumors
confined to the nasopharynx. Involvement of the parapharyn-
geal space is defined as posterolateral infiltration from the
nasopharynx beyond the buccopharyngeal fascia into the
triangular space lateral to the pharynx.Nasopharyngeal carcinoma often presents with early lym-
phatic spread. The retropharyngeal nodes and the cervical
nodes (both jugular and spinal accessory chains) are involved,
often bilaterally. The lymphatic spread in NPC follows a
predictable and orderly pattern from upper to lower neck;
"skip" metastasis is rare.21,28

In clinical evaluation, the maximum dimension (in any
direction) of the nodal mass, the laterality, and the lowest
level of neck involvement should be assessed. Midline nodes
are considered ipsilateral nodes. Nodal size larger than 6 cm
in greatest dimension and/or extension below the caudal bor-
der of the cricoid cartilage are associated with the worst
prognosis.Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is notorious for a high risk of dis-
tant metastasis. The most common sites include lung, bone,
liver, and distant lymph nodes. Involvement of lymph nodes
below the clavicle (including mediastinum, infraclavicular
region, axilla, or groin) is considered as distant metastases.Clinical staging is employed for NPC. Assessment is based
primarily on thorough history, physical examination, indirect
or direct endoscopy, and imaging. Physical examination
should include neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves,
palpation of neck nodes (greatest dimension, laterality, loca-
tion, and lowest extent of nodal involvement), and exclusion
of gross signs of distant metastases. Indirect or direct endos-
copy should assess the extent of anterior involvement into
the nasal cavities and inferior infiltration into the oropharynx
and hypopharynx. Biopsy should be taken for histological
confirmation. Routine testing for complete blood picture,
renal, and liver functions (including alkaline phosphatase)
are indicated.Cross-sectional imaging studies covering the nasopharyn-
geal and cervical regions are essential for clinical staging of
NPC. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the study of
choice because of its multiplanar capability, superior soft tis-
sue contrast, and sensitivity for detecting skull base and
intracranial tumor spread. Computed tomography (CT)
imaging with axial and coronal thin section technique with
contrast is an alternative. Regional nodal status (greatest
dimension in any direction, laterality, location, and lowest
extent of nodal involvement) should be assessed; measure-
ment of the maximal diameter of nodal disease should not be
confined to the axial radiological plane only.  
Metastatic workup is recommended for patients with node-
positive or locally advanced (T3-4) disease, those with symp-  
toms, signs, and/or biochemical tests suggestive of distant
metastasis. Whole body 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)
positron emission tomography (PET) coupled with CT is
increasingly used because of its sensitivity for detecting distant
metastases and second primary malignancy, the possibility of
its supplementing MR imaging in assessing nodal status,29 and
its use of the maximal standard uptake values (SUVmax) as an
additional independent prognostic predictor.30,31 Assessment
by CT thorax and upper abdomen (or chest X-ray and abdomi-
nal ultrasound) and bone scan is an alternative.Unlike other head and neck cancer, NPC is primarily treated
by radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, with no
resection of the primary cancer. This makes pathological
classification largely irrelevant. Surgery to primary or neck
nodes is used only for recurrence.Although additional factors may contribute to refining prog-
nostication, none have an adequate level of evidence and
consistent cut-off value that attain consensus for incorpora-
tion as staging criteria.
