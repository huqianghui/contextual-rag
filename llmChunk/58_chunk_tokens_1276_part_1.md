The lungs are the most common site of distant metastases;
skeletal or hepatic metastases occur less often. Mediastinal
lymph node metastases are considered distant metastases,
except level VII lymph nodes.Clinical staging is essential for squamous cell carcinomas of
the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Assessment is based pri-
marily on inspection and on indirect and direct endoscopy.
Palpation of sites (when feasible) and of neck nodes is essen-
tial. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is required.
Complete endoscopy, usually under general anesthesia, is
performed after completion of other staging studies, to assess
the surface extent of the tumor accurately and to assess deep
involvement by palpation for muscle invasion and to facili-
tate biopsy. A careful search for other primary tumors of the
upper aerodigestive tract may be indicated because of the
potential of multiple independent primary tumors occurring
simultaneously.  

In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal
mass should be measured. There are three categories of
clinically involved nodes for the oropharynx: N1, N2, and
N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior
mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph
nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to describe
the N category, regional lymph nodes should also be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
