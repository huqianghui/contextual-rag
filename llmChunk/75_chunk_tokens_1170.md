Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of
additional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all ill-
nesses in the patient's medical record is essential to
assessment of these parameters. General performance
measures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC
strongly recommends the clinician report performance
status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance measures,
along with standard staging information. An interrelation-
ship between each of the major performance tools exists.

</table>Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be measured indirectly by weight loss of>5% of body
weight in the previous 6 months.9 Depression adversely
impacts quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.1º AJCC Level of Evidence: IIIThe role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. Exactly how this could be codified in the staging
system, however, is less clear. At this time, smoking is known
to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is difficult to
accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤10 pack-years,
\>10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used to
evaluate published statistical prediction models for the pur-
pose of granting endorsement for clinical use.11 Although this
is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medicine,
this work was published only very recently. Therefore, the
existing models that have been published or may be in clini-
cal use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by the
Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the sta-
tistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.
