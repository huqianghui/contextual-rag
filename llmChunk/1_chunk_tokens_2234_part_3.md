#### Rules for Classification
Because a fundamental difference in outcome was observed for cases based on the number of nodes confirmed pathologically and the clinical presence of contralateral nodes and nodes larger than 6cm, two systems were developed for these two clinical scenarios. Pathological TNM (pTNM) applies only if the patient undergoes surgery and uses the pathological characteristics of the primary tumor and the number of positive nodes obtained from pathological examination of the surgically resected tissue. Clinical TNM (cTNM) utilizes information from available history, physical examination, and whatever imaging is performed. It is clear that to accurately enumerate clinically involved lymph nodes is not possible for a worldwide pretreatment clinical stage classification; that parameter, therefore, is confined to pTNM. It is recommended that clinical staging data be collected on ALL patients for the purposes of pretreatment assessment, providing a uniform standard for comparing cases across treatment centers around the world and for treatment planning, including selection of postsurgical treatment and prediction of prognosis.
