The lymph nodes in the neck may be subdivided into specific
anatomic subsites and grouped into seven levels for ease of
description (Fig. 6.1, Tables 6.1 and 6.2).  
Other groups not included in these levels are  
· Suboccipital  
· Retropharyngeal  
· Parapharyngeal  
· Buccinator (facial)  
· Preauricular  
· Periparotid and intraparotid

</figure>When enlarged lymph nodes are detected, the size of the
nodal mass(es) should be measured and their location should
be recorded in terms of the levels of the neck (Tables 6.1 and
6.2). The presence of ENE can be diagnosed clinically by the
presence of involvement of overlying skin, fixity to adjacent
soft tissue, or clinical signs of cranial nerve or brachial plexus,
sympathetic chain or phrenic nerve invasion. The presence of
clinically evident gross ENE is designated cENE(+).  
Pathological confirmation of metastasis by a fine-needle
aspirate, needle biopsy, excisional biopsy of a lymph node,
or a sentinel node procedure should be assigned cN.
