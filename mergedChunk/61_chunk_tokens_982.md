The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard to
apply accurately to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack years.The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.13 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medi-
cine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore,
the existing models that have been published or may be in
clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by
the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the
statistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.Oropharynx (p16-)
