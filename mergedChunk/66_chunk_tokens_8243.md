#### INTRODUCTION  
Malignancies that arise in the epithelial lining of the parana-
sal sinuses and nasal cavity, with the exception of lymphoma
and sarcoma, are staged according to this system. Many his-
tologic subtypes exist and also are a factor in determining
prognosis.4 T category is identical to the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 7th
Edition (7th Edition). As in other head and neck sites, the N
category has been expanded to incorporate extranodal exten-
sion (ENE).5  
The role of ENE in prognosis of head and neck cancers
is profound. Accounting for this important prognostic fea-
ture was considered critical in revising staging. Most of the
data supporting ENE as an adverse prognostic factor are
based on histopathological characterization of ENE, espe-
cially the distinction between microscopic and macro-
scopic or gross ENE.3,6,7 As per the "uncertain rule" of the
AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)
staging, which mandates that the lower category should
always be assigned in ambiguous cases, a case should be
categorized as ENE(-) unless there is unquestionable
ENE. For clinical ENE, the known inability of current
imaging modalities to define ENE accurately mandated
that stringent criteria be met prior to assigning a clinical
diagnosis of ENE.8 However, unambiguous evidence of
gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion of skin,
infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adjacent
structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic
trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) sup-
ported by strong radiographic evidence permit classifica-
tion of disease as ENE(+). Pathological ENE also will be
clearly defined in this chapter. Again, if there is doubt or
uncertainty of the presence of ENE, the case should be cat-
egorized as ENE(-).  
Cancer of the maxillary sinus is the most common of the
sinonasal malignancies. Ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity
cancers are equal in frequency, but considerably less com-
mon than maxillary sinus cancers. Tumors of the sphenoid
and frontal sinuses are rare.

<!-- PageNumber="139" -->  
#### ANATOMY  
##### Primary Site(s)  
The location and the extent of the mucosal lesion within the
maxillary sinus have prognostic significance. Historically, a
plane connecting the medial canthus of the eye to the angle
of the mandible, represented by Ohngren's line, is used to
divide the maxillary sinus into an anteroinferior portion
(infrastructure), which is associated with a good prognosis,
and a posterosuperior portion (suprastructure), which has a
poor prognosis (Fig. 12.1). The poorer outcome associated
with suprastructure cancers reflects early invasion by these
tumors to critical structures, including the orbit, skull base,
pterygoid plates, and infratemporal fossa.  
For the purpose of staging, the nasoethmoidal complex is
divided into two sites: nasal cavity and ethmoid sinuses. The
ethmoids are further subdivided into two subsites: left and
right, separated by the nasal septum (perpendicular plate of
ethmoid). The nasal cavity is divided into four subsites: the  
septum, floor, lateral wall, and the edge of naris to mucocu-
taneous junction.

#### Regional Lymph Nodes  
Regional lymph node spread from cancer of nasal cavity and
paranasal sinuses is relatively uncommon. Involvement of
buccinator, prevascular facial, submandibular, upper jugular,
and (occasionally) retropharyngeal nodes may occur with

advanced maxillary sinus cancer, particularly those extend-
ing beyond the sinus walls to involve adjacent structures,
including soft tissues of the cheek, upper alveolus, palate,
and buccal mucosa or overlying skin. Ethmoid sinus cancers
are less prone to regional lymphatic spread. When only one
side of the neck is involved, it should be considered ipsilat-
eral. Bilateral spread may occur with advanced primary can-
cer, particularly with spread of the primary beyond the
midline.  
#### Metastatic Sites  
Distant spread usually occurs to lungs, but occasionally there
is spread to bone.  
#### RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION  
##### Clinical Classification  
The assessment of primary maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, and
ethmoid tumors is based on inspection and palpation, includ-
ing examination of the orbits, nasal and oral cavities, and
nasopharynx, and neurologic evaluation of the cranial
nerves. Nasal endoscopy with rigid or fiberoptic flexible
instruments is recommended for inspection and biopsy.  
Neck nodes are assessed by palpation. In clinical evalu-
ation, the maximum size of any nodal mass should be
measured. Biopsy, when indicated, is done with a fine nee-
dle and not open approach and is included in clinical clas-
sification if done. The three categories of clinically involved
nodes for the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus are N1, N2,
and N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes.
Superior mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional
lymph nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to
describe the N category, regional lymph nodes should also
be described according to the level of the neck that is
involved. Provide a description or map of the regional
lymph nodes and node groups that the cancer affects.
Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE (i.e., defined as inva-
sion of skin, infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent
structures on clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial
plexus, sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with
dysfunction) is a sufficiently high threshold to classify
these as clinical ENE(+). Examinations for distant metasta-
ses include appropriate imaging, blood chemistries, blood
count, and other routine studies as indicated. Biopsy is typi-
cally needed to confirm metastasis, although a risk-to-ben-
efit ratio is always weighed and is included in clinical stage
as pM1 if done.  
Imaging studies showing amorphous spiculated margins
of involved nodes or involvement of internodal fat result-  
ing in loss of normal oval-to-round nodal shape strongly
suggest extracapsular (extranodal) tumor spread. No imag-
ing study (as yet) can identify microscopic foci in regional
nodes or distinguish between small reactive nodes and
small malignant nodes without central radiographic
inhomogeneity.  
##### Imaging  
Imaging is beneficial for lesions that cannot be fully assessed
on clinical examination, locally advanced disease, or symp-
tomatic patients. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging are complementary imaging stud-
ies for staging patients with cancers involving the nasal cav-
ity and/or the paranasal sinuses. There is no indication for
plain films or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT for
staging of the primary site. PET-CT may be helpful for
assessing nodal metastases; however, lymph node staging is
discussed in Chapter 6.  
CT is superior to MR imaging for identifying bone ero-
sion of thin walls and septa of the paranasal sinuses. CT is
superior to MR imaging for identifying involvement of the
hard palate. Either CT or MR imaging may be performed for
tumor extending outside of the nose and/or paranasal sinuses
to involve the adjacent structures, including the orbital apex
(T4b). MR imaging, especially with T2-weighted images, is
helpful for tumor mapping and for distinguishing between
tumor extension and obstructed secretions. Tumors may
obstruct the frontal recess or sphenoethmoidal recess, which
may result in obstruction of the frontal or sphenoid sinus,
respectively. Differential between tumor extension and pro-
teinaceous obstructed secretions is best performed with MR
imaging, which will help accurately identify T4a tumors.
Both CT and MR imaging may be used to evaluate for poste-
rior spread to the pterygopalantine fossa. However, MR
imaging is superior to CT for evaluating for retrograde peri-
neural spread along V2 through foramen rotundum or V3.
CT is superior to MR imaging for early cortical involvement,
but MR imaging is superior to CT for bone marrow invasion.
MR imaging also is superior to CT for identifying dural
involvement or other types of intracranial extension (T4b).  
##### Pathological Classification  
Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional nodal
dissections, followed by pathological examination of the
resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation for
pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected after
radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and consid-
ered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived from
the invasion of bone, orbit, dura, and presence of disease in
multiple subsites. Pathological staging represents additional
and important information and should be included as such in  
<!-- PageBreak -->  
<!-- PageNumber="141" -->
<!-- PageHeader="12 Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses" -->  
staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as the pri-
mary staging scheme.  
For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include
10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical
neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph
nodes. Negative pathological examination of a smaller num-
ber of nodes still mandates a pNO designation.  
##### Definition of ENE and Description of Its Extent  
All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined
for the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of
ENE has varied in the literature over the course of time. The
American College of Pathologists defines ENE as extension of
metastatic tumor, present within the confines of the lymph
node, through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding
connective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.  
ENE detected on histopathologic examination is desig-
nated as ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be
required for current pN definition, but data collection is rec-
ommended to allow standardization of data collection and
future analysis.  
#### PROGNOSTIC FACTORS  
##### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping  
Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.  
##### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care  
###### Extranodal Extension (ENE)  
ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
beyond the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE extension (i.e., defined as invasion of skin,
infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on
clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a
sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical
ENE(+). AJCC Level of Evidence: III  
###### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influences
outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using  
both tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart
abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer regis-
trars to obtain important information regarding specific fac-
tors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions.  
###### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.9 Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patient's medical record is essential to the assessment
of these parameters. General performance measures are
helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recom-
mends the clinician report performance status using the
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or
Karnofsky performance measures, along with standard stag-
ing information. An interrelationship between each of the
major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: III

</table>  
###### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking
in pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per
week and number of drinks per day will provide impor-
tant data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to
prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss
of>5% of body weight in the previous 6 months.10
Depression adversely impacts quality of life and survival.
Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depression
should be recorded in the medical record.11 AJCC Level
of Evidence: III  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard
to accurately apply to the staging system.  
<!-- PageNumber="12" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->  
<!-- PageNumber="142" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->  
Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.  
#### RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS  
The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.12 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medi-
cine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore,
the existing models that have been published or may be in
clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site
by the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future,
the statistical prediction models for this cancer site will be
evaluated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be
endorsed.
