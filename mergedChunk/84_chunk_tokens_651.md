Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of
additional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patient's medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful
in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the
clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures, along with standard staging
information. An interrelationship between each of the major
performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II13

</table>Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be indirectly measured by weight loss of>5% of body
weight in the previous 6 months.14 Depression adversely
affects quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.15 AJCC Level of Evidence: IIIThe role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. Exactly how this could be codified in the staging
system, however, is less clear. At this time, smoking is known
to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is difficult to
accurately apply this to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important
element of the demographics and may be included in
Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum
standard should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10
pack-years, > 10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.
