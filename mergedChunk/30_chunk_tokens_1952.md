#### Histology Codes  
This list includes histology codes and preferred terms from
the WHO Classification of Tumors and the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Most of
the terms in this list represent malignant behavior. For cancer
reporting purposes, behavior codes /3 (denoting malignant
neoplasms), /2 (denoting in situ neoplasms), and in some
cases /1 (denoting neoplasms with uncertain and unknown
behavior) may be appended to the 4-digit histology codes to
create a complete morphology code.

unspecified or outdated diagnosis. Data collectors may use this code
only if there is not enough information in the medical record to docu-
ment a more specific diagnosis.
