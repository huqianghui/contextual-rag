The most common sites of distant spread are in the lungs
and bones; hepatic and brain metastases occur less often.
Mediastinal lymph node metastases are considered distant
metastases, except level VII lymph nodes (anterior superior
mediastinal lymph nodes cephalad to the innominate artery).No large database registry systems have collected data with
sufficient validation on ENE to demonstrate long-term sur-
vival. However, abundant data support its adverse prognostic
effect.7 The inclusion of ENE in defining the N category
based on these data will allow future validation and modifica-
tion as necessary.  
Anatomic sites and histologic types for Head and Neck
cancers are coded according to the 3rd Edition of the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-
O-3). The subsites included in each analysis were chosen on
the basis of those listed in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual,
5th Edition (5th Edition).  
Treatment paradigms influence the type and quality of
data available for use in prognostication and staging. Cancers
that are largely treated using nonsurgical modalities (e.g.,
nasopharynx) will obviously not have pathological data
comparable to cancers that are treated surgically (e.g., oral
cavity cancer). Therefore, in these disease sites, parameters
that require pathological examination, such as number of
involved lymph nodes or microscopic ENE, cannot be evalu-
ated in a significant proportion of patients with head and
neck cancer.  
Oral cavity cancer represents the most common situation
for which histopathologic data are commonly available for
relatively large numbers of patients and, therefore, is the one
anatomic site that has undergone significant revisions in T
category. Additionally, the N categorization for all sites was

<!-- PageNumber="62" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->  
heavily influenced by the data from oral cavity cancer. Oral
cavity cancer outcomes were analyzed using a large data set
of patients treated at two tertiary cancer care centers in North
America comprising patients treated with a common staging
and treatment strategy (Table 5.3).14 Comparable cancer reg-
istry data sets on oral cancer are not available, so these revi-
sions based on single institutional data have not yet been
validated on large populations. The following description of
the process of stage revision of oral cancer vividly illustrates
the importance of high-fidelity data collection and the need
for comparable cancer registry data for future iterations of the
staging system.  
The T criteria for oral cancer patients were modified
based on the DOI of the primary tumor, which has long been
recognized as an important predictor of outcome. The basis
for this modification is the report from the International
Consortium for Outcomes Research in Head and Neck
Cancer.14 Outcomes based on the revised T criteria are shown
in Fig. 5.2 and Table 5.4.  
The N category criteria also were revised for the 8th
Edition to incorporate the influence of ENE on prognosis.
The preliminary analysis of the influence of ENE on progno-
sis was performed on a data set from the National Cancer
Data Base (NCDB) that included patients treated in 2010-
2011. The data on ENE from other sites also have been pub-
lished widely in institutional data sets and support inclusion
in the 8th Edition (Fig. 5.3).  
These new N criteria were then validated using the
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-Princess Margaret
Hospital (MSKCC-PMH) institutional data set (Fig. 5.4 and
Table 5.5).15  
After validation of the N criteria, the next step was to
examine the interplay of these new T and N criteria for stage
grouping. The NCDB data could not be used for this purpose
because of the lack of information on depth of information of
the primary tumor. The MSKCC-PMH data set was therefore
used for stage group analysis using 7th Edition AJCC/UICC
criteria (Fig. 5.5 and Table 5.6).15  
As seen in Fig. 5.5, the 7th Edition stage groupings
were unable to discriminate between Stage II and Stage
III, an effect that may largely be attributable to the redis-
tribution of prognostic weight introduced by the addition
of DOI and the relatively lower prognostic impact of low-
volume nodal metastatic disease, especially with the addi-
tion of adjuvant treatment. In recognition of these newer
prognostic factors, the MSKCC-PMH data were re-inter-
rogated after appropriate adjustment of the stage groups,
resulting in better discrimination of stage groups (Fig. 5.6
and Table 5.7).  
However, these stage groupings could not be validated on
cancer registry data because comparable data on DOI of the
primary tumor and ENE were not recorded for 7th Edition
AJCC/UICC staging. Therefore, although institutional data  
that support restructuring stage groups for oral cavity cancer
exist, the stage groupings will remain unchanged pending
future validation.
