The major changes in the 8th Edition for head and neck can-
cer reflect the changing environment of head and neck oncol-
ogy. The areas highlighted in this section include general
changes and additions to cancer staging that apply across
most Head and Neck sites. The specific changes for each site
are detailed in the respective chapters.  
#### New and Restructured Chapters  
A major addition is a restructured head- and neck-specific
cutaneous malignancy chapter. This acknowledges the
increasing need for head and neck oncologists to stage cuta-
neous malignancies.  
The Pharynx chapter has been divided into three separate
anatomic regions that better reflect the different diseases
arising in the pharynx.  
· Nasopharynx has its own chapter recognizing the
unique biology and etiology of this disease.

· HPV-negative oropharynx and hypopharynx remain
together in view of their shared biology and typical
risk factors.  
· A new chapter describing the staging of human papil-
loma virus-associated (HPV) oropharyngeal cancers
(OPC) has been added.  
The rapidly increasing incidence of high-risk HPV
(HR-HPV) associated cancers of the tonsil and tongue base
has posed numerous challenges in diagnosis, management
strategies, and outcomes reporting.3 The AJCC Cancer
Staging Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition) TNM staging of
OPC tumors lacks hazard discrimination, hazard consis-
tency, and capacity to predict outcome. HR-HPV associated
cancers occur more often in younger, healthier individuals
with little or no tobacco exposure. HPV16/18 are the most
commonly detected transcriptionally active HR-HPV types.
The established staging criteria defined in the 7th Edition are
insufficient to adequately stage and define the biology of this
emerging disease. Immunohistochemistry for p16 overex-
pression has emerged as a robust surrogate biomarker for
HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and as an independent posi-
tive prognosticator in this specific context.4 Direct detection
of HPV is not used as a defining factor due to limited avail-
ability of the test, cost, and lack of additional ability to pre-
dict survival compared with p16 overexpression. p16
overexpression was chosen as the best identifier of disease
because of its low cost, universal applicability, and ease of
reading compared with other HPV identifiers. It is important
to remind clinicians, however, that p16 overexpression is
context-specific and currently applicable only to the tonsillar
and base of tongue regions of the oropharynx. Designation of
p16 overexpression should occur only when there is signifi-
cant staining following established criteria.4 To increase the
utility of staging and acknowledge the emergence of a dis-
tinct disease, the p16+ and p16- OPCs are now separately
described. OPC with p16 expression of weak intensity or
limited distribution (<75% of cells) should be staged using
oropharyngeal carcinoma p16- guidelines.  
The 8th Edition TNM staging system for HPV-related can-
cers of the oropharynx provides better discrimination between
stages. T categories remain the same for both p16+ and p16-,
except that the p16+ classification includes no Tis category
and no T4b, and p16- oropharynx, like other non-HPV associ-
ated cancers in the head and neck, includes no TO category.  
The p16+ clinical TNM classification is applicable to all
cases before treatment (both surgically and non-surgically
treated cases). The pathological classification is confined to
cases managed with surgery (following examination of the
resected specimens, as with all other pathologically staged
tumors).  
A unique and potentially perplexing feature of pathologi-
cal staging in HPV+ is that in the data set, pN3 category  
behaves as Stage I while pN2 behaves as Stage II. This find-
ing is unprecedented, and only prospective collection of data
will help clarify this apparent paradox.5  
#### Rules for Classification  
Because a fundamental difference in outcome was observed
for cases based on the number of nodes confirmed pathologi-
cally and the clinical presence of contralateral nodes and
nodes larger than 6cm, two systems were developed for
these two clinical scenarios. Pathological TNM (pTNM)
applies only if the patient undergoes surgery and uses the
pathological characteristics of the primary tumor and the
number of positive nodes obtained from pathological exami-
nation of the surgically resected tissue. Clinical TNM
(cTNM) utilizes information from available history, physical
examination, and whatever imaging is performed. It is clear
that to accurately enumerate clinically involved lymph nodes
is not possible for a worldwide pretreatment clinical stage
classification; that parameter, therefore, is confined to
pTNM. It is recommended that clinical staging data be col-
lected on ALL patients for the purposes of pretreatment
assessment, providing a uniform standard for comparing
cases across treatment centers around the world and for treat-
ment planning, including selection of postsurgical treatment
and prediction of prognosis.  
#### Definition of Primary Tumor (T): Changes  
Throughout the head and neck chapters, the Primary Tumor
(T) categories (for size and extent of the primary tumor) are
generally similar, with changes in the skin, nasopharynx, and
oral cavity chapters. A key change from prior editions of the
TNM system is the elimination of the TO category in sites
other than nasopharynx and HPV+ oropharynx. Specific
changes include the following:  
· T categorization for skin cancer recognizes the critical
importance of depth of invasion beyond 6 mm and peri-
neural invasion, both of which upstage a lesion to T3.  
· In nasopharynx, the previous T4 criteria “masticator
space" and "infratemporal fossa" are replaced by a
specific description of soft tissue involvement to avoid
ambiguity. Adjacent muscle involvement (including
medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and prevertebral
muscles) is designated as T2.  
· The biggest change in T category is for the oral cavity.
Depth of invasion (DOI) has been added as a modifica-
tion to T to enhance the distinction between the super-
ficial or exophytic tumors and those that are more
invasive. Clinicians have long recognized the very dif-  
<!-- PageBreak -->  
<!-- PageNumber="57" -->
<!-- PageHeader="5 Staging Head and Neck Cancers" -->  
ferent biological behaviors between these types of
lesions, and this is now acknowledged by increasing
the T category for every 5-mm increase in DOI in three
categories: less than or equal to 5 mm; greater than
5 mm, but not greater than 10mm; and greater than
10mm). It is important to recognize the distinction
between tumor thickness and true DOI. It has been
recognized since the early work of Spiro and co-work-
ers, in the mid-1980s, that prognosis of oral cancers
worsens as the tumor grows thicker, as with skin
malignancies.6 The somewhat more sophisticated
measure of DOI has been recorded for oral cavity can-
cers since the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 6th
Edition (6th Edition). Clinicians experienced with
head and neck cancer generally will have few prob-
lems identifying a superficial and less invasive lesion
(≤5mm) from those of moderate depth (>5 mm
and ≤10mm) or deeply invasive cancers (>10mm)
through clinical examination alone. Such experts have
estimated the maximum dimensions for complicated
lesions of the tonsil or palate for many years. In apply-
ing the DOI modifier, if there are doubts or ambiguity,
the clinician should apply the general TNM uncer-
tainty staging rule of using the lower attribute for a
category (in this case a lower DOI categorization).  
· Extrinsic muscle infiltration is no longer a staging
criterion for T4 designation in oral cavity, because
depth of invasion supersedes it and extrinsic muscle
invasion is difficult to assess (both clinically and
pathologically).  
· An additional change is the elimination of the TO cate-
gory for all oral cavity, skin, larynx, HPV- oropharynx,
hypopharynx, and sinus. This change affects cases where
a cervical lymph node has metastatic squamous cell car-
cinoma, but no primary tumor is identified despite thor-
ough history, examination, and available imaging
studies. Assigning these cases to a specific head and
neck site is not possible. Previous editions of TNM stag-
ing included a TO category in each of these disease sites.
However, it is seldom used and, if it is, the cancer could
not be assigned to a stage group. Therefore, for the 8th
Edition, the Expert Panel eliminated the TO category
from the head and neck staging systems. A separate stag-
ing system for those cases with an involved cervical
node without a known primary tumor has been added to
the chapter entitled Cervical Node and Unknown
Primary of the Head and Neck. These cases should be
classified under the TNM rules for a cancer of unknown
primary outlined in that chapter.  
· The exceptions where TO continues to be used as a
T-category are HPV-associated cancer and Epstein-
Barr Virus (EBV) associated cancers. For HPV-
associated cancers identified in a cervical lymph  
node (defined as p16 positive), the case is staged
using the p16 positive oropharynx system, which
continues to include a "TO" category. EBV-positive
cancers identified in a cervical node with no obvious
primary are staged using the EBV-related nasophar-
ynx system, in which the "TO" category is main-
tained. TO is allowed for salivary gland cancers
identified by their unique histology.
