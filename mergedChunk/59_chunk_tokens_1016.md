The subsite of the oropharynx should be clarified (palatine/
lingual tonsil, tonsillar pillar, posterior pharyngeal wall, soft
palate). The size of the primary tumor should be measured
along its longest diameter to determine whether this is T1 (≤
2cm), T2 (>2 cm and ≤4cm) or T3 (>4cm). It may be diffi-
cult to be certain by imaging whether a base of tongue tumor
is extending along the mucosal surface of the lingual aspect of
the epiglottis (also T3), or whether the exophytic tumor is
abutting against this surface. In these situations, clarification
by direct clinical observation is essential. T4 disease is deter-
mined by invasion anteriorly to the extrinsic muscles of the
tongue in the floor of the mouth or from the soft palate anteri-

orly to the hard palate, laterally into the pterygoid muscles or
mandible, inferiorly to the larynx or superiorly to the skull
base or beyond. Skull base involvement also necessitates care-
ful evaluation for perineural and intracranial spread of tumor.
Cross-sectional imaging of hypopharyngeal carcinoma is rec-
ommended to define the extent of the primary tumor, particu-
larly its deep extent in relationship to adjacent structures (i.e.,
larynx, cricoid and thyroid cartilage, esophageal muscle, cer-
vical vertebrae, and carotid sheath). CT is preferred currently
because it entails less motion artifact than MR imaging.  
CT and MR imaging afford some view of the lungs for
metastases, albeit with only a small volume of the lungs
being imaged and with low sensitivity for MR imaging. A
complete staging report includes evaluation of the lung api-
ces for potential metastases and of the bones of the skull and
cervical spine for metastatic disease. PET/CT allows more
accurate and complete evaluation for distant metastatic dis-
ease, which is most often to the lung, bone, and liver.  
There are specific pitfalls in imaging that relate to the imag-
ing modality being used or to strict interpretation of the defini-
tions of tumor involvement. Detection of metastatic involvement
of nodes with either CT or MR imaging requires careful evalu-
ation of multiple morphological features: size, shape, density
(intensity on MR imaging), necrosis, and extranodal spread of
tumor. It is important to review all criteria and not merely the
size of a lymph node. This should also be performed in con-
junction with knowledge of the expected drainage pattern of
the tumor. As stated previously, oropharyngeal tumors most
often drain to the upper and mid jugular nodes (levels 2 and 3
respectively), and bilateral drainage is frequent. These nodal
sites should be carefully scrutinized for abnormal shape, size,
contour, and texture. The retropharyngeal nodes (RPN) should
also be evaluated, particularly when a posterior pharyngeal
wall tumor is present. Keep in mind that unless cystic or
necrotic, RPN frequently appear isodense to the adjacent pre-
vertebral muscles on CT making them readily overlooked.
Imaging studies showing amorphous spiculated margins of
involved nodes or involvement of internodal fat resulting in
loss of normal oval-to-round nodal shape suggest extranodal
spread of tumor but are not sufficient without corresponding
evidence on physical examination to classify as ENE(+).  
PET/CT for head and neck malignancies are best per-
formed with contrast-enhanced CT portions of the examina-
tion and preferably with dedicated smaller field of view
(FOV) neck images. When iodinated contrast is not employed
for PET/CT, it is also difficult to evaluate for specific sites of
disease involvement that might upstage a tumor. For exam-
ple, determining the presence of medial or lateral pterygoid
muscle involvement (both T4) by a tonsillar carcinoma is
difficult when relying on non-contrast large FOV CT for cor-
relation with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET uptake.  
Some subtleties of tumor involvement for staging also
require clarification. The palatoglossus muscle forms the
muscle bulk of the anterior tonsillar pillar and may be  
invaded with even a relatively small tonsillar or tonsillar pil-
lar tumor. Although palatoglossus is defined as an extrinsic
muscle of the tongue, involvement of this muscle within the
oropharynx does not denote a significantly poorer prognosis
for the patient and does not change the T category.
