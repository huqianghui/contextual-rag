The risk of regional metastasis generally is related to the T
category. The incidence and distribution of cervical nodal
metastases from cancer of the larynx vary with the site of ori-
gin and the T category of the primary tumor. The true vocal
cords are nearly devoid of lymphatics, and tumors limited to

the glottis alone rarely spread to regional nodes. By contrast,
the supraglottis has a rich and bilaterally interconnected lym-
phatic network, so primary supraglottic cancers commonly are
accompanied by regional lymph node spread. Advanced glot-
tic tumors may spread directly to adjacent soft tissues, to pre-
laryngeal, pretracheal, paralaryngeal, and paratracheal nodes,
as well as to upper, mid, and lower jugular nodes. Supraglottic
tumors commonly spread to upper and mid jugular nodes,
considerably less commonly to submental or submandibular
nodes, and occasionally to retropharyngeal nodes. The rare
subglottic primary tumors spread first to adjacent soft tissues
and prelaryngeal, pretracheal, paralaryngeal, and paratracheal
nodes, then to mid and lower jugular nodes. Contralateral lym-
phatic spread is common. Any previous manipulation to the
neck, through surgery or radiation, may alter normal lym-
phatic drainage patterns, resulting in unusual distribution of
regional spread of disease to the cervical lymph nodes.Distant spread is common only for patients who have bulky
regional lymphadenopathy. When distant metastases occur,
spread to the lungs is most common; skeletal or hepatic
metastases occur less often. Mediastinal lymph node metas-
tases are considered distant metastases, except Level VII
lymph nodes (in the anterior superior mediastinum, cephalad
to the innominate artery).
