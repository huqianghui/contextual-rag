<figcaption>Fig. 13.3 T1 for the supraglottis is defined as tumor limited to one
subsite of supraglottis (shown here in the epiglottis) with normal vocal
cord mobility Fig. 13.5 T2 for the supraglottis is defined as tumor invading the
mucosa of more than one adjacent subsite of supraglottis or glottis or
region outside the supraglottis (e.g., mucosa of base of tongue, vallec-
ula, and medial wall of pyriform sinus) without fixation of the larynx
(shown here with tumor involvement in the suprahyoid and mucosa of
the infrahyoid epiglottis)</figcaption>

subsite of supraglottis (shown here in the ventricular bands) with nor-
mal vocal cord mobility Fig. 13.6 T2 for the supraglottis with invasion of ventricular bands
(false cords) and the epiglottis</figcaption>

<figcaption>Fig. 13.7 T3 for the supraglottis is defined as tumor limited to larynx
with vocal cord fixation and/or invading any of the following: postcri-
coid area, preepiglottic tissues, paraglottic space, and/or inner cortex of
thyroid cartilage (shown here with invasion of the supraglottis and
vocal cord with vocal cord fixation) Fig. 13.8 T3 for the supraglottis with invasion of the preepiglottic tis-
sues with vocal cord fixation Fig. 13.9 T4a for the supraglottis is defined as
moderately advanced local disease, tumor invading
through the thyroid cartilage and/or invading tissues
beyond the larynx (e.g., trachea, soft tissues of neck,
including deep extrinsic muscle of the tongue, strap
muscles, thyroid, or esophagus). Here, tumor has invaded
beyond the larynx into the vallecula and base of the
tongue, as well as into soft tissues of the neck</figcaption>

<figcaption>Fig. 13.11 T1 tumors of the glottis are limited to the vocal cord(s)
with normal mobility (may involve anterior or posterior commissure).
Tla tumors are limited to one vocal cord (top right) and T1b tumors
involve both vocal cords (bottom right) Fig. 13.13 T3 tumors of the glottis are limited to the larynx with vocal
cord fixation (shown), and/or invade paraglottic space and/or inner cor-
tex of the thyroid cartilage</figcaption>
