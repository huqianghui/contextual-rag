Standard nomenclature is unsatisfactory in describing HPV-
mediated p16+ oropharyngeal cancers. The descriptor of
"poorly differentiated," which is based on a high nuclear/
cytoplasmic ratio, is at odds with the known improved prog-
nosis. Therefore, tumor classification as "poorly differenti-
ated oropharyngeal carcinoma" should be avoided. "Basaloid
squamous carcinoma" nosology implies palisading tumor
cells, basement membrane deposition, and cribriform-like
morphology, which also is not the typical phenotype of HPV-
mediated p16+ oropharyngeal cancer. The terminology of
"oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma, nonkeratinzing-type"
is recommended, acknowledging that "nonkeratinizing" is a
low-power descriptor. Observation at higher power confirms
that individual cell keratinization and tumor maturation is
quite common and compatible with the "nonkeratinizing"
descriptor. Grading is not relevant in this context.  
The histopathology of HPV-mediated p16+ oropharyn-
geal cancers is characteristic and easily recognizable. The
carcinoma may form nests, islands, or ribbons of tumor cells
with either limited cytoplasm ("basaloid"), moderate amount
of cytoplasm (epithelioid), or individual cell keratinization.
If a ribbon-like pattern is present (transitional pattern), then
tumor maturation and flattened keratinizing cells are seen.
Frank tumor keratinization and keratin pearls usually predict
no association with either HPV-mediated carcinogenesis or
p16 overexpression. In the event that a keratinizing pheno-
type does demonstrate p16 overexpression, it should be
staged in this chapter.  
The "inside out" pattern of maturation is another char-
acteristic feature; keratinizing tumor cells are localized
to the periphery of tumor islands, and proliferating tumor
cells are centrally located (Fig. 10.3) This is the converse
of the maturation pattern usually seen in non-HPV-medi-
ated keratinizing squamous carcinoma. Anaplastic tumor
cells with multinucleated or bizarre nuclei can be seen in
HPV-mediated p16+ oropharyngeal cancers, and are a poor
prognosticator.9

an unknown primary are staged in this chapter if p16

<figcaption>Fig. 10.3 In the context of oropharyngeal cancer, these histologies are
predictive of HR-HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and p16 overexpres-
sion.5 (a) These cancers typically are composed of basaloid tumor cells
with minimal cytoplasm. Individual cell keratinization may be
observed at high power; however, overt keratinization is usually not
seen at low-power observation. (b) "Inside out" maturation-The
peripheral rim of the tumor islands is composed of flattened keratiniz- ing tumor cells, while the proliferating more immature cells are cen-
trally located. This is distinct from the usual non-HPV-mediated
keratinizing squamous carcinoma, which reveals central keratiniza-
tion, and proliferating tumor cells at the periphery of tumor islands.
(c) Anaplastic tumor cells, as well as multinucleated tumor cells can be
seen in these carcinomas Fig. 10.4 HR-HPV-mediated
oropharyngeal cancer can form
cystic metastases in cervical
lymph nodes, whereas the
primary carcinoma is usually
solid.5 It is unnecessary to
document extranodal extension
in this context. This
phenotype, plus p16
overexpression, can be
especially useful for tumors of
unknown primaries. (Top)

overexpression is documented and the histology is consistent
with HPV-mediated carcinogenesis. These metastatic carci-
nomas are invariably cystic and include the other findings
enumerated above (Fig. 10.4). "Normalization" or maturation
of metastatic squamous carcinoma to the point of mimick-
ing a benign cyst is a well-recognized phenomenon; thus the
diagnosis of "malignant transformation of a branchial cleft
cyst" should be rejected. In these cases, additional viral in situ  
hybridization studies (HR-HPV, EBER) are recommended.
Ciliated squamous carcinoma cells have been observed
within both cystic primary and metastatic HPV-mediated
cancers, which may also cause diagnostic confusion.10  
Finally, there is the potential for confusing nonaggressive
pattern of tumor invasion with noninvasive carcinoma. The
epithelial crypts of Waldeyer's ring are lined by specialized
reticulated epithelium, which is thinner than stratified

squamous epithelium and characterized by abundant intraep-
ithelial lymphocytes and mononuclear cells. The basement
membrane in this region is composed of fine, discontinuous
fibers, thus enabling lymphocyte trafficking.11,12 Because of
the lack of a complete, well-defined basement membrane,
the idea of in situ carcinoma within these crypts is incorrect.
HPV-mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma most often reveals
a nonaggressive pattern of invasion (e.g., transitional pattern,
which is reminiscent of urinary bladder carcinoma). The
smooth, ribbon-like contours of this pattern plus the lack of
desmoplastic response might lead the pathologist toward a
mistaken diagnosis of in situ carcinoma (Fig. 10.4).
