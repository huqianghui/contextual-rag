Both CT and MR imaging are beneficial and may occasion-
ally be complimentary for staging of major salivary gland
tumors. MR imaging provides better tissue characterization
and is more accurate than CT for properly identifying pleo-
morphic adenomas or acinic cell carcinomas. There is no
defined role of positron emission tomography-CT or other
nuclear medicine studies for the initial evaluation of salivary
gland malignancies. Technetium pertechnetate studies have
been reported to be beneficial in identifying Warthin tumors.
However, the clinical benefit is debatable if biopsy is being
considered.  
Both modalities can be used to measure the lesion and
help assess tumor size and extension. Imaging can be helpful
for lesions that cannot be fully assessed on clinical examina-
tion, locally advanced disease, or symptomatic patients.
Both modalities also are helpful in determining if the tumor
has spread through the surrounding capsule of the salivary
gland into the extraparenchymal tissues. Both modalities can
be used to evaluate for carotid encasement. MR imaging is
superior to CT for assessing for perineural spread.
Specifically, MR imaging should be performed to evaluate
for the presence of retrograde perineural spread along the
facial nerve at the skull base, extending through the stylo-
mastoid foramen to involve the mastoid segment of the facial
nerve. CT is superior to MR imaging for early cortical skull
base involvement, but MR imaging is superior to CT for
bone marrow invasion. The role of imaging in evaluating
nodal metastases is discussed in Chapter 6, Cervical Lymph
Nodes and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and Neck.  
Radiology reports should include information on the
following:  
1\. Primary Tumor: Primary site and local spread, with
specific mention of structures that would change stag-
ing to T4a or T4b  
2\. Status of lymph node metastases  
3\. Presence of distant spreadComplete resection of the primary site and/or regional nodal
dissections, followed by pathological examination of the
resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation for  
pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected after
radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and consid-
ered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived from
the actual measurement of the unfixed tumor in the surgical
specimen. It should be noted, however, that up to 30%
shrinkage of soft tissues may occur in resected specimen
after formalin fixation. Pathological staging represents addi-
tional and important information and should be included as
such in staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as
the primary staging scheme.  
For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include
10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical
neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph
nodes. Negative pathological examination of a smaller num-
ber of nodes still mandates a pNO designation.All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined
for the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of
ENE has varied in the literature over time. The American
College of Pathologists defines ENE as extension of meta-
static tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding con-
nective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.
Gross ENE (Eg) is defined as tumor apparent to the naked
eye beyond the confines of the nodal capsule. Microscopic
ENE (Em) is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, pres-
ent within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Only gross ENE is used
to define pathological ENE(+) nodal status.  
ENE detected on histopathologic examination is desig-
nated as ENEmi (microscopic ENE â‰¤2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be
required for current pN definition, but data collection is rec-
ommended to allow standardization of data collection and
future analysis.Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.
