T categories are the same for clinical and pathological stag-
ing. However, a different pathological N category is pro-
posed for p16+ OPC, based on data from the Washington
University School of Medicine.7-9 High metastatic node
number rather than extracapsular spread, laterality, or nodal
size is the key prognosticator in surgically resected, neck-
dissected p16+ oropharynx cancer.8  
One interesting finding in this surgically managed dataset
is that N3 disease behaves unusually well and is equivalent to
N1; therefore, N3 is eliminated from pN categorization. The
favorable outcome for N3 is not apparent in the clinical data-
set. Unlike other head and neck sites, extranodal extension
(ENE) may not have the same prognostic significance, pro-
vided that adjuvant treatments are administered according to
conventional practice. Additionally, NO did not discriminate  
between the N1 category but has been left in the neck cate-
gory as NO for data collection and historical reasons.  
Primary tumor resection is required to assign pathologi-
cal stage and may be performed using transoral or conven-
tional techniques. Current trends strongly favor transoral
approaches, because they diminish morbidity significantly.
For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include 10
or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical neck
dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph nodes.
Negative pathologic examination of a lesser number of nodes
still mandates a pNO designation.
