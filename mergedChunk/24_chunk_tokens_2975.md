#### Clinical Classification  
Clinical staging for Oral Cavity cancers is predicated most
strongly upon the history and physical examination. Biopsy
is necessary to confirm diagnosis and is typically performed
on the primary. Nodal biopsy is done by fine needle aspira-
tion when indicated. Results from diagnostic biopsy of the
primary tumor, regional nodes, and distant metastases can be
included in clinical classification.  
Inspection of the oral cavity typically reveals the greatest
diameter of a cancer, though palpation is essential to assess
DOI and submucosal extension. The mucosal extent of the
cancer usually reflects its true linear dimension. Induration

surrounding a cancer typically is due to peritumoral inflam-
mation. DOI should be distinguished from tumor thickness,
and its determination is predicated on invasion beneath the
plane defined by surrounding normal mucosa. Any exophytic
character should be noted, but assignment of stage is deter-
mined by what transpires at or beneath the surface (defined by
adjacent normal mucosa). Clinical evidence of bone destruc-
tion should be noted and its depth estimated (e.g., into bone
versus through cortex into the marrow space). Thick lesions
often are defined by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging, but the difference between thick-
ness and DOI must be observed. Lesions located near the
midline more often involve the contralateral side of the neck
than well-lateralized cancers. Dysphagia is suggestive of a
tumor with sufficient invasion of oral structures to engender
dysfunction. It is seldom present when cancers have little
DOI. Similarly, drooling or the inability to swallow liquids
without difficulty suggests a tumor with substantial
DOI. Trismus, when not caused by pain, is consistent with a
deeply invasive lesion. Complaints of numbness of the lip
and/or teeth are commonly associated with nerve invasion.
Clinicians experienced with head and neck cancer will gener-
ally have few problems distinguishing less invasive lesions (≤
5 mm) from those of moderate depth (from > 5 to ≤ 10 mm)
or deeply invasive cancers (> 10 mm) through examination
alone. Such experts have estimated the maximum dimensions
for complicated lesions of the tonsil or palate for many years.
However, the distinction between 4 mm DOI and 6 mm DOI
(for example) may not be possible on clinical grounds. A
higher T category should be assigned on the basis of DOI
only if the differences in DOI are clear.  
Evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction should be sought
(testing sensation and motion to command) and skin should
be examined for evidence of invasion by underlying nodes.
Palpable neck nodes should be considered in terms of their
location (level in the neck), size, number, character (smooth
or irregular), attachment to other nodes, and mobility. Nodes
that do not move in all directions may be invading nearby
structures. Invasion of the sternomastoid muscle and/or cra-
nial nerves is associated with lateral motion with restricted
ability to move the node along the cranial-caudal axis.
Inability to move the node at all (without moving the head) is
worrisome for ENE, though the suspicion should be tempered
for smaller nodes with limited mobility in level II. Assignment
of clinical ENE should be based almost entirely upon the
physical examination, rather than upon imaging studies; gross
ENE is required to raise the cN category beyond the assign-
ment based upon node size and number, and this may be over-
estimated with current imaging modalities.  
#### Clinical or radiographic extranodal extension  
ENE worsens the adverse outcome associated with nodal
metastasis. The presence of ENE can be diagnosed clini-
cally by the presence of a "matted" mass of nodes, involve-
ment of overlying skin, adjacent soft tissue, or clinical signs  
of cranial nerve or brachial plexus, sympathetic chain or
phrenic nerve invasion. Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR)
generally has low sensitivity (65-80 %) but high specificity
(86-93 %) for the detection of ENE. The most reliable imag-
ing signs are an indistinct nodal margin, irregular nodal cap-
sular enhancement or infiltration into the adjacent fat or
muscle, with the latter finding on CT and MR imaging as the
most specific sign of ENE. Ultrasound appears to be less
accurate than CT and MR imaging, but ENE is suggested by
interrupted or undefined nodal contours with high-resolu-
tion ultrasound imaging. The absence or presence of clinical/
radiologic ENE is designated ENE(-) or ENE(+),
respectively.  
#### Imaging  
Cross-sectional imaging of the oral cavity may be performed
with either CT or MR imaging, depending on availability,
patient imaging tolerance, contrast allergies, and cost. With
either modality, the coronal plane view-either as direct MR
imaging or from reformats obtained from axially acquired
thin-slice CT-allows excellent evaluation of the floor of the
mouth.9 CT offers some advantage over MR imaging in the
evaluation of cortical bone erosion, although MR imaging
appears to be more sensitive but less specific for the detec-
tion of bone marrow invasion by tumor.10, 11 MR imaging
offers the additional advantage of evaluation of perineural
tumor spread, which for oral cavity tumors is primarily along
the inferior alveolar nerve (CNV3) of the mandible and the
greater and lesser palatine nerves (CNV2) of the maxilla.
Gadolinium contrast is always recommended unless contra-
indicated by prior reaction or very poor renal function.
Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is primarily done
for nodal staging of disease or when distant metastases are
suspected, unless the CT component is performed as a post-
contrast examination with dedicated neck imaging.
Ultrasound does not allow adequate evaluation of the oral
cavity primary tumor site, but it may be a useful adjunct for
estimating DOI and for nodal evaluation with otherwise
equivocal nodal imaging findings.  
As small but clinically evident mucosal tumors may be
subtle on imaging, it is important to review the imaging
exam with knowledge of the tumor site. T1, T2, and T3
tumors are distinguished only by size and depth of invasion.
The former is better determined by clinical examination,
although a radiologic measurement should be given as part
of the imaging report. The radiologist's more important role
during tumor staging is to determine deep tissue involve-
ment and assess for nodal and/or distant metastases. T4 dis-
ease entails invasion into adjacent bone, sinus or skin or else
large transverse size (> 4 cm) and greater than 10 mm DOI,
which varies according to the specific subsite of the oral
cavity. For alveolar ridge, floor of mouth, retromolar trian-
gle, hard palate, and large lip tumors, careful attention
should be paid to the cortex and marrow space of the adja-
cent maxilla or mandible, because such invasion denotes

T4a disease. In the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th
Edition, oral tongue tumors were designated T4a when there
was deep invasion into the extrinsic muscles of the tongue
and/or the floor of the mouth. DOI supersedes muscle inva-
sion in the 8th Edition. Depth is frequently better evaluated
in the coronal plane and/or sagittal plane. More posterior
extensive spread of tumor-such as buccal tumors invading
into the muscles of mastication, or spreading to the ptery-
goid plates or superiorly to the skull base-denotes T4b
tumor. Additionally, posterolateral tumor spread to surround
the internal carotid artery is also T4b disease.  
Both CT and MR imaging allow evaluation of nodal
morphology to determine possible tumor involvement.
Levels IA, IB, and IIA are the most frequently involved
sites, and these levels should be scrutinized specifically
with concern for rounded contour, heterogeneous texture
including cystic or necrotic change, enlargement, and ill-
defined margins. It also is important to be cognizant that
nodal spread may be bilateral, particularly with anterior
and/or midline oral cavity tumors. Midline nodes are con-
sidered ipsilateral. Skip nodal metastases (level IV without
level III involvement) while described with lateral tongue
tumors, appear to be rare. As previously described, PET/CT
may also be used to improve predictive yield for nodal
metastases by the addition of physiologic information, and
ultrasound may be an additive tool for evaluation of indeter-
minate nodes. PET/CT is the only modality to allow whole-
body evaluation of distant metastatic spread, and the upper
lungs and bone should always be reviewed as potential met-
astatic sites on any staging neck CT or MR imaging.  
The risk of distant metastasis is more dependent on the N
than on the T status of the head and neck cancer. In addition
to the node size, number, and presence of ENE, regional
lymph nodes also should be described according to the level
of the neck that is involved. The level of involved nodes in
the neck is prognostically significant for oral cavity (caudad
nodal disease is worse), as is the presence of ENE from
individual nodes. Imaging studies showing amorphous spic-
ulated margins of involved nodes or involvement of inter-
nodal fat resulting in loss of normal oval-to-round nodal
shape strongly suggest extranodal extension; however, path-
ological examination is necessary to prove its presence. No
imaging study can currently identify minor ENE in meta-
static nodes, microscopic foci of cancer in regional nodes or
distinguish between small reactive nodes and small nodes
with metastatic deposits (in the absence of central radio-
graphic inhomogeneity).  
#### Pathological Classification  
Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional lymph
node dissections, followed by pathological examination of
the resection specimen allows for the use of this designation
for pT and/or pN, respectively. Resections after radiation or  
chemotherapy should be identified and considered in con-
text. pT is derived from the actual measurement of the
unfixed tumor in the surgical specimen. It should be noted,
however, that up to 30% shrinkage of soft tissues may occur
in resected specimen after formalin fixation. Pathological
staging represents additional and important information and
should be included as such in staging, but it does not sup-
plant clinical staging as the primary staging scheme.
Metastasis found on imaging is considered cM1. Biopsy-
proven metastasis is considered pM1.  
#### Pathological assessment of the primary tumor  
Specimen prosection must separately address three issues:
DOI, resection margins, and WPOI; it is best to submit differ-
ent tissue cassettes documenting each prognosticator. DOI is
assessed relative to adjacent normal mucosa. If carcinoma
invades medullary bone, or subcutaneous tissues on gross
examination, then it is categorized as T4 and DOI become
irrelevant. The basic principle of resection margin assessment
is that each tissue plane that meets the surgeon (bone, mucosa,
soft tissue, vessels, and nerve) represents a resection margin
and requires evaluation. Each specimen can be thought of as a
multi-planed manifold; each cut surface from each orthogonal
plane represents a margin surface. Ideally, margin assessment
is performed as a comprehensive intraoperative process. Avoid
parallel shave margins for mucosal/soft tissue assessment. The
pitfall with shave margins is that they may be negative, but if
on permanent sections cancer is present on deeper sections,
the opportunity for measurements is lost. In the context of
intraoperative assessment, the mucosal and soft tissue margins
should be processed first, as these are actionable steps. Then
process further tissue sections deliberately aimed to assess
DOI and WPOI. WPOI sections are harvested from the tumor
advancing edge at the soft tissue interface.  
#### Pathological assessment of ENE  
Resected positive lymph nodes require examination for the
presence and extent of ENE. ENEmi is defined as microscopic
ENE ≤2 mm. Macroscopic ENE (ENEma) is defined as either
extranodal extension apparent to the naked eye at the time of
prosection and extension >2 mm beyond the lymph node
capsule microscopically. At the time of dissection, extrano-
dal extension can be identified as irregular, firm, white/grey
tumor at the interface with soft tissue. This still requires his-
tologic documentation. The "naked eye" assessment is
important if no residual lymph node structure can be found
microscopically. By contrast, intact lymph node capsules are
smooth, and separate easily from surrounding fat. ENEmi
and ENEma are used to define pathological ENE(+) nodal
status. Stretching of the lymph node capsule by carcinoma
does not constitute ENE; microscopic evidence of breaching
the capsule, with extension into surrounding soft tissue, with
or without tissue reaction, constitutes ENE.  
For assessment of pN, a selective neck dissection will ordi-
narily include 15 or more lymph nodes, and a comprehensive

neck dissection (radical or modified radical neck dissection)
will ordinarily include 22 or more lymph nodes. Examination
of fewer tumor-free nodes still mandates a pNO designation.
