The following anatomic definition of the larynx allows clas-
sification of carcinomas arising in the encompassed mucous
membranes but excludes cancers arising on the lateral or
posterior pharyngeal wall, pyriform fossa, postcricoid area,
or base of tongue.  
The anterior limit of the larynx is composed of the ante-
rior or lingual surface of the suprahyoid epiglottis, the thyro-
hyoid membrane, the anterior commissure, and the anterior
wall of the subglottic region, which is composed of the thy-
roid cartilage, the cricothyroid membrane, and the anterior
arch of the cricoid cartilage.  
The posterior and lateral limits include the laryngeal
aspect of the aryepiglottic folds, the arytenoid region, the
interarytenoid space, and the posterior surface of the sub-
glottic space, represented by the mucous membrane covering
the surface of the cricoid cartilage.  
The superolateral limits are composed of the tip and the
lateral borders of the epiglottis. The inferior limits are made
up of the plane passing through the inferior edge of the cri-
coid cartilage.  
For purposes of this clinical stage classification, the lar-
ynx is divided into three regions: supraglottis, glottis, and
subglottis (Fig. 13.1). The supraglottis is composed of the  
epiglottis (both its lingual and laryngeal aspects), aryepi-
glottic folds (laryngeal aspect), arytenoids, and ventricular
bands (false cords) (Fig. 13.2). The epiglottis is divided for
staging purposes into suprahyoid and infrahyoid portions
by a plane at the level of the hyoid bone. The inferior
boundary of the supraglottis is a horizontal plane passing
through the lateral margin of the ventricle at its junction
with the superior surface of the vocal cord. The glottis is
composed of the superior and inferior surfaces of the true
vocal cords, including the anterior and posterior commis-
sures (Fig. 13.2). It occupies a horizontal plane 1 cm in
thickness, extending inferiorly from the lateral margin of
the ventricle. The subglottis is the region extending from
the lower boundary of the glottis to the lower margin of the
cricoid cartilage.  
The division of the larynx is summarized as follows:
