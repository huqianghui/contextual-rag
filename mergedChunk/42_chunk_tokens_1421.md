#### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors, the overall
health of these patients clearly influences outcome. An ongo-
ing effort to better assess prognosis using both tumor and
nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart abstraction will
continue to be performed by cancer registrars to obtain
important information regarding specific factors related to
prognosis. These data will then be used to further hone the
predictive power of the staging system in future revisions.
AJCC Level of Evidence: II  
#### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all illnesses in
the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful

in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends that
the clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures, along with standard staging informa-
tion. An interrelationship between each of the major perfor-
mance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

#### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be indirectly measured by weight loss of>10% of body
weight. Depression adversely impacts quality of life and sur-
vival. Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depres-
sion should be recorded in the medical record. AJCC Level
of Evidence: III  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard to
accurately apply to the staging system. Smoking history
should be collected as an important element of the demo-
graphics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the
future. For practicality, the minimum standard should clas-
sify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤20
pack-years, or>20 pack-years.The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.32 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision
medicine, this work was published only very recently.
Therefore, the existing models that have been published or  
may be in clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this
cancer site by the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In
the future, the statistical prediction models for this cancer
site will be evaluated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria
will be endorsed.<table>
