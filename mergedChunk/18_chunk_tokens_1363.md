The data underpinning inclusion of ENE in the staging system
are derived from histopathological examination of neck dis-
section specimens in patients treated surgically for their head
and neck cancer. The modification is based on analysis of a
large National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) data set, including
cases with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,
with the exception of HPV-related oropharynx cancer and
nasopharynx cancer (Fig. 6.5). The new N category was then
tested for validation on another large collaborative data set
from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York,
and Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, for surgically treated
oral cancer patients (Fig. 6.6 and Table 6.3). The lack of ENE
data in patients treated by nonsurgical modalities is problem-
atic because currently available radiographic techniques are

not sensitive enough to detect microscopic or less than gross
ENE. Therefore, only clinically obvious ENE should be used
for definition of cN when the patient is treated with nonsurgi-
cal therapy. This inability of current technology to reliably
identify minimal or microscopic ENE without pathological
examination of lymph node dissection specimens was the
basis for separate cN and pN approaches for staging the neck.
Clinically overt ENE (ENE.) will be designated cN3b irre-
spective of any other nodal characteristic in patients treated
without neck dissection. Histologically identified ENE (ENEmi
or ENEma) in a neck dissection specimen will be used in con-
junction with node size and laterality for pN: Histo-
pathologically confirmed ENE in a single ipsilateral or
contralateral metastatic node 3 cm or smaller in largest dimen-
sion upstages the patient to pN2a, while all other nodes with
histopathologically detected ENE are categorized pN3b.  
Up-to-date cancer registry data on the influence of the
new N criteria on outcomes are not available because ENE is
only now being introduced into the nodal staging system.
Limited data are available, however, from the NCDB for
patients treated in 2010-11 for squamous cell carcinoma at
sites other than nasopharynx and HPV-related oropharynx
cancer (Fig. 6.5). The proposed new N classification was
then validated in a large dataset of patients with oral cancer
treated at two tertiary cancer care centers in North America.
