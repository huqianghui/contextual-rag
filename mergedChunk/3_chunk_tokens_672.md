An ongoing effort to evaluate the effect on prognosis of both
tumor and non-tumor-related factors is underway. Cancer reg-
istrars should continue to perform chart abstraction to collect
information regarding specific factors related to prognosis as
outlined in each chapter. These data will be used to enhance
the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions.
Key domains of information to collect include the following:  
· Comorbidity: In addition to the importance of the TNM
factors outlined previously, the overall health or presence
of comorbid conditions of patients influences outcome.
Comorbidity can be assessed and semi-quantified using
validated standardized tools applied by review of medical
records.9 Accurate reporting of all major illnesses in the
patient's medical record is essential. General performance
measures are helpful in predicting survival.  
· Performance Status: In addition, the AJCC strongly
recommends that the clinician report performance sta-
tus using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance mea-
sures, along with standard staging information.  
· Lifestyle factors: Tobacco and alcohol abuse adversely
influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking (in
pack-years) and alcohol consumption (in number of
days drinking per week and number of drinks per day)
will provide important data for future analysis.
However, exactly how these should be incorporated in
staging remains undefined. Smoking is known to have
a deleterious effect on prognosis, but valid data are
insufficient to allow it to be readily introduced into the
staging systems. Smoking history should be collected
as an important element of the demographics and may
be included in Prognostic Groups in the future. For
practicality, the minimum standard should classify
smoking history as follows: never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, > 20 pack-years.  
· Nutrition: Nutrition also is important to prognosis and
can be indirectly measured by weight loss of> 10% of
body weight over 3 months.10  
· Depression: Depression adversely impacts quality of
life and survival.11, 12 A previous or current diagnosis
of depression should be recorded in the medical record.The status of the regional lymph nodes in head and neck can-
cer is of such prognostic importance that the cervical nodes
must be assessed for each patient and tumor. The lymph

nodes in the head and neck are subdivided into specific ana-
tomic subsites and grouped into seven levels for ease of
description (Fig. 5.1, Tables 5.1 and 5.2).  
In addition to the standard groups listed in Tables 5.1 and 5.2,
other lymph node groups are defined by their specific anatomic
location. Numbers of nodes are counted toward N category, but
they are listed separately using the following descriptors.  
· Suboccipital  
· Retropharyngeal  
· Parapharyngeal  
· Buccinator (facial)  
· Preauricular  
· Periparotid and intraparotid
