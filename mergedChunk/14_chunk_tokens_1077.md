Abnormal lymph nodes should be described according to the
level of the neck that is involved, using the standard imaging-
based classification (Table 6.1).  
Ultrasonography (US) is a convenient and commonly
used modality for assessment of the neck. However, interpre-
tation is observer dependent and certain areas, such as the
retropharyngeal nodes and mediastinal nodes, cannot be
assessed with US. Currently, its utility is being defined in the
assessment of ENE. Computed tomography (CT) or mag-
netic resonance (MR) imaging can be used for evaluating all
nodal levels for metastatic involvement, with particular
attention to the expected drainage pattern of the primary
tumor site. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission
tomography (PET) may increase sensitivity and specificity
over cross-sectional imaging alone for nodal detection,
although small and cystic nodes may be falsely negative
while reactive nodes may be falsely positive.  
A maximum short-axis diameter of 10 mm for lymph nodes
is commonly used to describe abnormal nodes, although this
results in a high false-negative rate. Because size criteria alone
are not reliable, small nodes, particularly in the expected drain-
age levels of the primary site, should be carefully evaluated.
Enlarged or round nodes with loss of normal oval contour and/
or loss of the fatty hilus, and nodes with focal nodal inhomoge-
neity suggestive of necrosis or cystic change should be sought.  
Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR imaging) generally
has low sensitivity (65-80%) but high specificity (86-93 %)
for the detection of ENE. US appears to be less accurate in
assessment of ENE than CT and MR imaging, and its utility
is currently being defined. ENE is suggested by interrupted
or undefined nodal contours with high-resolution US imag-
ing. Several CT or MR imaging features suggest ENE, such
as indistinct nodal margins and irregular nodal capsular

enhancement; however, the strongest imaging feature sup-
porting the clinical diagnosis for ENE is clear infiltration
into the adjacent fat or muscle. (Figs. 6.2 and 6.3) This limi-
tation of current technology limits the definitive nonsurgical  
diagnosis of ENE to only those patients who have clinically
obvious signs described above. As noted, the presence of
clinically obvious ENE is designated ENE ..Histopathological examination is necessary to exclude the
presence of tumor in lymph nodes because no imaging study
as yet is accurate enough to identify microscopic tumor foci
in regional nodes or distinguish between small reactive nodes
and small malignant nodes. When a histopathologically
involved node is identified, pN is designated based on mea-
surement of the largest dimension of the metastatic deposit
and not of the entire lymph node.  
An excisional biopsy of a lymph node does not qualify
for full evaluation of the pN category and should be
assigned cN.  
Pathological examination is necessary for documentation
of tumor extent in terms of the location or level of the lymph
node(s) involved, the number of nodes that contain metasta-
ses, and the presence, absence, and extent of ENE.For assessment of pN, an adequate neck dissection ordinarily
will include 15 or more lymph nodes in a previously untreated
patient. Examination of fewer tumor-free nodes in a neck
dissection specimen still mandates a pNO designation.Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) are described as the first nodes
directly draining lymph from the primary tumor. SLN biopsy
has been used as a staging procedure for the clinically nega-
tive neck in certain sites, such as oral cancer. Negative histo-
pathological examination of SLNs justifies cNO when
sentinel node biopsy is part of the diagnostic workup and
also is used for pathological categorization (pNO) in those
cases that meet other criteria for pathological staging (e.g.,
resection of the primary tumor). The positive sentinel node
also may be used to classify as pN1, though patients with
positive SLNs usually undergo lymphadenectomy, and pN
status is assigned based on assessment of the neck dissection
specimen if performed.
