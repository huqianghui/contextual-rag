The risk of regional nodal spread from cancers of the pharynx
is high. Oropharyngeal cancers usually involve upper and mid-
jugular lymph nodes and (less commonly) submental/subman-
dibular nodes. Base of tongue cancers often manifest bilateral
lymphatic drainage. Hypopharyngeal cancers spread to adja-
cent parapharyngeal, paratracheal, and mid- and lower jugular
nodes. Bilateral lymphatic drainage is common. In clinical

evaluation, the maximum size of the nodal mass should be
measured. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes.
Superior mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional
lymph nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to
describe the N category, regional lymph nodes should also be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.The lungs are the most common site of distant metastases;
skeletal or hepatic metastases occur less often. Mediastinal
lymph node metastases are considered distant metastases,
except level VII lymph nodes.Clinical staging is essential for squamous cell carcinomas of
the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Assessment is based pri-
marily on inspection and on indirect and direct endoscopy.
Palpation of sites (when feasible) and of neck nodes is essen-
tial. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is required.
Complete endoscopy, usually under general anesthesia, is
performed after completion of other staging studies, to assess
the surface extent of the tumor accurately and to assess deep
involvement by palpation for muscle invasion and to facili-
tate biopsy. A careful search for other primary tumors of the
upper aerodigestive tract may be indicated because of the
potential of multiple independent primary tumors occurring
simultaneously.  
In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal
mass should be measured. There are three categories of
clinically involved nodes for the oropharynx: N1, N2, and
N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior
mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph
nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to describe
the N category, regional lymph nodes should also be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
Provide a description or map of the regional lymph nodes
and node groups that the cancer affects. Unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE extension (i.e., defined as invasion of
skin, infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent struc-
tures on clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus,
sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunc-
tion) is a sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clini-
cal ENE (ENE.) and qualifies as ENE(+) for definition of cN.  
Evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction should be sought
(testing sensation and motion to command) and skin should
be examined for evidence of invasion by underlying nodes.
Palpable neck nodes should be considered in terms of their
location (level in the neck), size, number, character (smooth  
or irregular), attachment to other nodes, and mobility. Nodes
that do not move in all directions may be invading nearby
structures. Invasion of the sternomastoid muscle and or cra-
nial nerves is associated with lateral motion but restricted
ability to move the node along the cranial-caudal axis.
Inability to move the node at all (without moving the head) is
worrisome for ENE, though the suspicion should be tem-
pered for smaller nodes with limited mobility in level
II. Assignment of ENE should be based almost entirely upon
the physical examination, rather than upon imaging studies;
gross ENE is required to raise the stage beyond the assign-
ment based upon node size and number and this may be
overestimated with current imaging modalities.  
The known lack of ability for radiographic imaging accu-
rately to define ENE suggests the need for stringent criteria
prior to assigning ENE on a clinical basis. Imaging studies
showing amorphous spiculated margins of involved nodes or
involvement of internodal fat resulting in loss of normal oval-
to-round nodal shape suggest extranodal spread of tumor but
are not sufficient without corresponding evidence on physical
examination. Pathological examination is necessary for doc-
umentation of such disease extent. No imaging study (as yet)
can identify microscopic foci in regional nodes or distinguish
between small reactive nodes and small malignant nodes
(unless central radiographic inhomogeneity is present).Both contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allow excellent evaluation
of the primary oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal tumor and
of nodal drainage sites. Positron emission tomography (PET)/
CT is being used with greater frequency for staging, treat-
ment evaluation, and surveillance. It may offer an advantage
in detection of an otherwise clinically occult primary tumor.  
Imaging staging of a known oropharyngeal or hypopha-
ryngeal tumor requires a systematic review of the primary
tumor, nodal drainage sites and imaged potential sites of
spread. For this purpose, structured reporting may offer
advantages to the radiologist for ensuring that critical infor-
mation is not omitted.
