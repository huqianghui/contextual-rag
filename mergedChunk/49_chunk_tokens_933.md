The oropharynx is the portion of the continuity of the
pharynx extending from the plane of the superior surface
of the soft palate to the superior surface of the hyoid
bone (or vallecula). It includes the base of the tongue,
including the lingual tonsil; the inferior (anterior) surface
of the soft palate and the uvula; the anterior and posterior
tonsillar pillars with the palatine tonsils; the glossoton-
sillar sulci; and the lateral and posterior pharyngeal
walls. (Fig. 10.2)  
HPV-mediated cancers most commonly arise in the lym-
phatic tissue of the palatine and lingual tonsil but may arise
in any of the regions of the oropharynx.Oropharyngeal cancers usually involve upper and midjugu-
lar lymph nodes and (less commonly) submental/subman-
dibular nodes. Base-of-tongue cancers commonly manifest
bilateral lymphatic drainage.  
Unknown primary (TO) nodal positive disease should be
staged using this section if a node is p16+ and no primary
site is identified.The most common site of distant metastasis is the lung
followed by bone.Clinical stage is based on reports from a large dataset from five
North American and two European Centers, the International
Collaboration for Oropharyngeal Cancer Network for Staging
(ICON-S). The ICON-S is a validation study following the
Princess Margaret Hospital report and contains approximately
3,000 cases, about 2,000 of which are HPV+.6  
This study showed that traditional NO to N2b nodal stages
are homogeneous for outcome within T1 and T2 categories

(creating Stage I). N2c and T3 have an intermediate stage
(Stage II), and T4 and N3 are the least favorable group (Stage
III). Stage IV is reserved for distant metastases. T categories
are the same for clinical and pathological staging.  
Clinical staging is generally employed for squamous
cell carcinomas of the pharynx. Assessment is based pri-
marily on inspection: indirect and direct endoscopy, as well
as imaging. Palpation of sites (when feasible) and of neck
nodes is essential. Diagnostic biopsy of the primary and/or
distant metastatic sites and the neck are part of clinical
staging. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is
required.  
In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal
mass should be measured. There are three categories of
clinically involved nodes for the oropharynx: N1, N2, and
N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior
mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph
nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to describe
the N category, regional lymph nodes also should be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
Provide a description or map of the regional lymph nodes
and node groups that the cancer affects. The role of extrano-
dal extension is less obvious in p16+ oropharyngeal cancer.
It is not a factor in staging this disease.Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is often the
first imaging study of choice with a new neck mass that is
suspected to be adenopathy, or when either metastatic nodal
disease or a primary oropharyngeal tumor is detected.
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the alternate cross-
sectional modality which may be employed for initial stag-
ing, post-treatment evaluation or surveillance. Both
modalities allow excellent evaluation of the primary oropha-
ryngeal tumor and of nodal drainage sites. Positron emission
tomography (PET)/CT is being used with greater frequency
for staging, treatment evaluation, and surveillance. It may
offer an advantage in the detection of an otherwise clinically
occult primary tumor and in exclusion of a viable tumor in
residual enlarged nodes after chemoradiation.  
Imaging staging of a known oropharyngeal tumor requires
a systematic review of the primary tumor, nodal drainage
sites, and imaged potential sites of spread. For this purpose,
structured reporting may offer advantages to the radiologist
for ensuring that critical information is not omitted.
