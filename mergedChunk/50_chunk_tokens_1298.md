The subsite of the oropharynx should be clarified (palatine/
lingual tonsil, tonsillar pillar, posterior pharyngeal wall, soft
palate). The size of the primary tumor should be measured
along its longest diameter to determine whether this is T1
(≤2 cm), T2 (>2 cm and ≤4 cm) or T3 (>4 cm). It may be
difficult to be certain by imaging whether a base-of-tongue
tumor is extending along the mucosal surface of the lingual  
aspect of the epiglottis (also T3) or whether the exophytic
tumor is abutting against this surface. In these situations,
clarification by direct clinical observation is essential. T4
disease is determined by invasion (1) anteriorly to the extrin-
sic muscles of the tongue in the floor of the mouth or from
the soft palate anteriorly to the hard palate, (2) laterally into
the pterygoid muscles or mandible, (3) inferiorly to the lar-
ynx, or (4) superiorly to the skull base or beyond. Skull base
involvement also necessitates careful evaluation for perineu-
ral and intracranial spread of the tumor. Description of the
extent of invasion of these specific structures with T4 tumors
is important for radiation planning and should be clearly
articulated in the report.  
CT and MR imaging afford some view of the lungs for
metastases, albeit with only a small volume of the lungs
being imaged and with low sensitivity for MR imaging. A
complete staging report includes evaluation of the lung
apices for potential metastases and of the bones of the
skull and cervical spine for metastatic disease. PET/CT
allows more accurate and complete evaluation for distant
metastatic disease, which is most often to the lung, bone,
and liver with HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma
(SCCa).  
Specific pitfalls in imaging relate to the imaging modality
being used or to strict interpretation of the definitions of
tumor involvement. Detection of metastatic involvement of
nodes with either CT or MR imaging requires careful evalu-
ation of multiple morphological features: size, shape, density
(intensity on MR imaging), necrosis, and extranodal exten-
sion of tumor. It is important to review all criteria and not
merely the size of a lymph node. This also should be per-
formed in conjunction with knowledge of the expected drain-
age pattern of the tumor. As stated previously, oropharyngeal
tumors most often drain to the upper- and midjugular nodes
(levels II and III, respectively), and bilateral drainage is fre-
quent. These nodal sites should be scrutinized carefully for
abnormal shape, size, contour, and texture. The retropharyn-
geal nodes (RPN) also should be evaluated, particularly
when a posterior pharyngeal wall tumor is present. Keep in
mind that unless cystic or necrotic, RPN frequently appear
isodense to the adjacent prevertebral muscles on CT, making
them readily overlooked.  
A common pitfall of PET/CT that is particularly pertinent
to the evaluation of HPV-related SCCa is the absence of ele-
vated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in cystic nodes. For
this reason, it is imperative that the CT component of the
staging examination be carefully evaluated for cystic (low-
density) nodes, which have too little solid tissue to demon-
strate elevated FDG activity. With this in mind, PET/CT for
head and neck malignancies are best performed with
contrast-enhanced CT portions of the examination and pref-
erably with dedicated smaller field of view (FOV) neck
images. When iodinated contrast is not employed for PET/
CT, it also is difficult to evaluate for specific sites of disease

involvement, which might upstage a tumor. For example,
determining the presence of medial or lateral pterygoid mus-
cle involvement (both T4) by a tonsillar carcinoma is diffi-
cult when relying on noncontrast large FOV CT for
correlation with FDG-PET uptake.  
Some subtleties of tumor involvement for staging also
require clarification. The palatoglossus muscle forms the
muscle bulk of the anterior tonsillar pillar and may be
invaded with even a relatively small tonsillar or tonsillar pil-
lar tumor. Although palatoglossus is defined as an extrinsic
muscle of the tongue, involvement of this muscle within the
oropharynx does not denote a significantly poorer prognosis
for the patient and does not change the T category. A final
imaging pitfall for consideration is during the imaging evalu-
ation of a carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP). Most
often, the small primary tumor is determined to be in the
ipsilateral pharyngeal or lingual tonsil, but particularly with
HPV-related tumors, it can be subtle and readily overlooked.
It is important to evaluate carefully the CT or MR imaging
for asymmetric size of ipsilateral tonsillar tissue and for
heterogeneous tonsillar enhancement. PET/CT is an alter-
nate modality if the lesion is not found on CT or MR images,
and is best performed prior to oropharyngeal biopsies to
avoid a false-positive FDG uptake.  
PET/MR imaging is an emerging modality; currently,
there are few sites where these scanners are available for
clinical imaging. MR images of the primary tumor and
nodes and measurements of FDG activity are obtained
simultaneously, resulting in fused PET/MR images. There
presently is little literature on PET/MR imaging for head
and neck tumors and none yet demonstrating increased
accuracy of PET/MR imaging over PET/CT for the staging,
followup, or surveillance of head and neck tumors. There
is reduced ionizing radiation to the patient with PET/MR
imaging as compared to PET/CT.
