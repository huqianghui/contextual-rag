The 8th Edition introduces the use of extranodal extension
(ENE) in categorizing the "N" category for metastatic cancer
to neck nodes. The effect of ENE on prognosis in head and
neck cancers is profound, except for those tumors associated
with HR-HPV.7 Including this important prognostic feature
was considered critical for improving staging.  
Most of the evidence supporting ENE as an adverse prog-
nostic factor is based on histopathological characterization
of ENE, especially the distinction between microscopic and
macroscopic (or gross) ENE. For clinical staging only, the
presence of unquestionable ENE as determined by physical
examination and supported by radiological evidence is to be
used. As per the standard rules of cancer staging, if there is
uncertainty or ambiguity for categorization of T, N, or M, the
lower category is assigned.  
Stringent criteria for clinical examination must be met to
assign a diagnosis of ENE. Current imaging modalities have
significant limitations in their ability to accurately identify
ENE.8 This mandates that radiological evidence alone is
insufficient. Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE on clini-
cal examination (e.g., invasion of skin, infiltration of muscu-
lature or dense tethering to adjacent structures, or cranial
nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve
invasion with dysfunction) supported by strong radiographic
evidence is required to permit clinical classification of dis-
ease as ENE(+).  
Pathological ENE also must be clearly defined as exten-
sion of metastatic tumor (tumor present within the confines
of the lymph node and extending through the lymph node
capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or with-
out associated stromal reaction). Again, when there is doubt
or ambiguity in the reporting, the lesser or lower category is
assigned, in this case ENE(-).All staging systems presented in this section are for clinical
staging, based on the best possible estimate of the extent of
disease before initiation of first treatment. Imaging tech-

niques-computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasonography-may be employed, but clinical examina-
tion is sufficient to assign clinical stage. In advanced tumor
stages, imaging studies add to the accuracy of primary
tumor (T) and nodal (N) categorization, especially in the
nasopharyngeal and paranasal sinuses primary sites, as well
as for regional lymph nodes. Endoscopic evaluation of the
primary tumor and examination under anesthesia when
appropriate may be needed for accurate T categorization.
These may be supplemented by needle biopsy (most often
fine-needle aspiration biopsy [FNAB]) to confirm the pres-
ence of tumor and its histopathologic nature, while recog-
nizing that a negative needle biopsy cannot rule out the
presence of tumor. When imaging studies are not done or
not available, as in low-resource regions, clinical stage may
be based solely on careful history, physical examination,
and/or endoscopy.  
Clinical stage should be reported for all cases, as well as
pathological stage when surgery is performed. Any diag-
nostic information that contributes to the overall accuracy
of the pretreatment assessment should be considered in
clinical staging and treatment planning. When surgical
treatment is carried out, cancer of the head and neck can be
staged pathologically (pTNM) using all information avail-
able from clinical assessment, as well as from the surgeon's
operative findings and pathological study of the resected
specimen.  
With the exception of p16+ OPC (a recently recognized
disease entity), no major changes in the stage groupings are
recommended. The current stage groupings reflect recent
practices, clinical relevance, and contemporary data. T4
tumors continue to be subdivided into moderately advanced
(T4a) and very advanced (T4b) categories. Stage IV disease
is divided into moderately advanced, local/regional disease
(Stage IVA), very advanced local/regional disease (Stage
IVB), and distant metastatic disease (Stage IVC).  
The following chapters present the staging classification
for nine major head and neck sites and disease entities:  
· Oral Cavity  
· Major Salivary Glands  
· Nasopharynx  
· HPV-Mediated (p16+) Oropharyngeal Cancer  
· Oropharynx (p16-) and Hypopharynx  
· Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses  
· Larynx  
· Mucosal Melanoma of the Head and Neck  
· Cutaneous Carcinoma of the Head and Neck  
· An additional chapter explaining Cervical Lymph
Nodes and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and
Neck is included for additional clarity and staging
information.
