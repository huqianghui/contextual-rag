#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping  
##### p16 Testing  
p16 immunotesting is mandatory to use this staging system
for HPV-associated cancer. HPV by in situ hybridization
(ISH) may be done as an alternative. If a case of oropharyn-
geal cancer does not have p16 or HPV by ISH, then the case
is staged by the p16- negative system (Chapter 11).#### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of these patients clearly influ-
ences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis
using both tumor- and nontumor-related factors is underway.
Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer
registrars to obtain important information regarding specific
factors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions. AJCC Level of Evidence: III  
#### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of
additional medical illnesses.13 Accurate reporting of all
illnesses in the patients' medical record is essential to
assess these parameters. General performance measures
are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly
recommends that the clinician report performance sta-
tus using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG)/Zubrod or Karnofsky performance measures,
along with standard staging information. An interrelation-
ship between each of the major performance tools exists.

#### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking
in pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per
week and number of drinks per day will provide impor-
tant data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to
prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss
of >5% of body weight in the previous 6 months. 14
Depression adversely affects quality of life and survival.
Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depression
should be recorded in the medical record.15 AJCC Level
of Evidence: III  
#### Tobacco Use  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard
to apply accurately to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years,
\> 10 but ≤20 pack-years, or >20 pack-years.The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used to
evaluate published statistical prediction models for the pur-
pose of granting endorsement for clinical use.16 Although this
is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medicine,
this work was published only very recently. Therefore, the
existing models that have been published or may be in clini-
cal use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by the

tistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.<table>
