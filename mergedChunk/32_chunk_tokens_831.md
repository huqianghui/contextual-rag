The assessment of primary salivary gland tumors includes a
pertinent history (pain, trismus, etc.), inspection, palpation,
and evaluation of the cranial nerves. Assessment is based pri-
marily on inspection and palpation of salivary glands, skin,
and neck nodes. Biopsy is typically by fine-needle aspiration
or by surgical resection of the tumor. Biopsy results may be
included as part of clinical classification. The presence of
fixation and trismus should be noted. Neurologic evaluation
of all cranial nerves is required, but special attention to the
facial nerve is mandatory. Careful assessment for pain and
hypesthesia of the skin is important.  
In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal
mass should be measured. The three categories of clinically
involved nodes are N1, N2, and N3. Midline nodes are
considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior mediastinal lymph
nodes are considered regional lymph nodes (level VII). In
addition to the components to describe the N category,
regional lymph nodes also should be described according to
the level of the neck that is involved. Provide a description or
map of the regional lymph nodes and node groups that the
cancer affects. Unambiguous evidence of gross extranodal
extension (ENE)-which is defined as invasion of skin, infil-
tration of musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clin-
ical examination, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, or
sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunc-
tion-is a sufficiently high threshold to classify these as
clinical ENE(+). Note that the results of a diagnostic biopsy
of regional nodes can be included as part of clinical
classification.  
ENE worsens the adverse outcome associated with nodal
metastasis.3,5-8 Cross-sectional imaging using computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) generally has
low sensitivity (65-80 %) but high specificity (86-93 %) for
the detection of ENE. The most reliable imaging signs are an
indistinct nodal margin, irregular nodal capsular enhance-
ment, or infiltration into the adjacent fat or muscle; the latter
finding on CT and MR imaging is the most specific sign of
ENE. Ultrasound appears to be less accurate than CT and
MR imaging, but ENE is suggested by interrupted or unde-
fined nodal contours with high-resolution ultrasound imag-
ing. The absence or presence of clinical/radiologic ENE is
designated ENE(-) or ENE(+), respectively.  
Only unquestionable ENE is to be used for clinical stag-
ing. As per the "uncertain rule" of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International
Cancer Control (UICC) staging, which mandates that the
lower category always be assigned in ambiguous cases, a
case should be categorized as ENE(-) unless there is
unquestionable ENE. For clinical ENE, the known inability
of current imaging modalities to define ENE accurately
mandated that stringent criteria be met prior to assigning a

clinical diagnosis of ENE.9 However, unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion
of skin, infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adja-
cent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction)
supported by strong radiographic evidence permits classifi-
cation of disease as ENE(+). Pathological ENE will be
clearly defined in this chapter. Again, if there is doubt or
uncertainty of the presence of ENE, the case should be cat-
egorized as ENE(-).
