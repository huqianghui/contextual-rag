HPV positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma

Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBER) by in situ
hybridization is recommended to confirm HPV mediation
and to exclude Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) origin, which sug-
gests nasopharyngeal origin. The "TO" category has been
eliminated for most head and neck squamous cell cancers,
and those with cervical nodes without a known primary can-
cer are staged using the cervical node system. However,
cases of HPV-associated (p16 positive cancers) cervical node
with no apparent primary are an exception. These cases are
staged using the system defined in this chapter and using the
"TO" category.  
Current TNM staging of HPV-related OPC tumors is non-
discriminating due to the unique nature of the disease. To
enhance the accuracy reflecting the biological behavior of
these cancers and to increase utility of staging, OPC staging
will be separately described as either p16 overexpressing
(p16+), or p16 negative (p16-). The most common scenario
is that p16+ is either diffuse and strong, or entirely negative.
Scientific literature has demonstrated that the cut point for
determining p16+ by immunohistochemistry is strong dif-
fuse expression (+2/+3 intensity and ≥ 75% distribution,
Fig. 10.1). The College of American Pathologists (CAP) has
suggested a similar distribution cut point of > 70%.4 As the
difference between 70% and 75% is trivial and cannot be
visually discriminated, we revise this cut point to 70% in
order to harmonize with the CAP Cancer Protocols. All
agree that nuclear staining is requisite. Oropharyngeal can-
cers with p16 expression of weak intensity or limited distri-
bution should be staged using OPC p16- guidelines (see

<figcaption>Fig. 10.1 In the context of oropharyngeal cancer, the optimal cut-off
for p16 overexpression as a surrogate HR-HPV biomarker is ≥+2/+3
nuclear staining intensity (+/- cytoplasmic staining) with ≥ 75% distri-
bution.5 (a) The typical p16 overexpression phenotype is greater than
this threshold. Here diffuse, robust nuclear and cytoplasmic overexpres- sion is seen. (b) A rarer positive pattern is that of p16 overexpression
limited to nuclei. (c) Nonspecific cytoplasmic p16 expression is usually
associated with limited staining distribution. Carcinomas with this
staining pattern are excluded from this chapter</figcaption>

Chapter 11). Additionally, p16+ presently is considered only
for oropharyngeal cancer; the role of p16+ at other anatomic
sites is unclear as yet. Direct detection of HPV will not be
used as a defining factor due to its difficulty in universal
availability and applicability, cost, and failure to stratify sur-
vival as well as p16 overexpression.  
A staging system that recognizes the rising incidence of
epidemic proportions of HPV-related cancers of the oro-
pharynx is needed for better discrimination between stages.
T categories will remain the same as traditional OPC for
both p16+ and p16-, except that the p16+ classification will
not include a Tis category, and there will not be a T4b
within T4.  
Like all other pathologically staged tumors, p16+ also has
a clinical TNM classification applicable to all cases before
treatment (surgically and nonsurgically treated cases) and a
pathological classification confined to cases managed with
surgery following examination of the primary tumor and
neck dissection specimens.
