An accurate staging system is crucial in cancer management
for predicting prognosis, guiding clinicians in treatment
decisions for different risk groups, and sharing experience on
results of treatment between centers. Prognostic significance
of staging system changes with advances in investigation and
treatment methods. Evaluation of staging systems to ensure  
continual suitability and exploration for further improve-
ment is essential.  
This chapter focuses on TNM staging for epithelial
tumors of the nasopharynx. Nonepithelial tumors such as
mucosal melanoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma of soft tissue,
bone, and cartilage are not included. Nasopharyngeal carci-
noma (NPC) has a very skewed geographic and ethnic distri-
bution, with 80% of the global burden in Asian countries.
The natural behavior and therapeutic consideration for NPC
are different from other head and neck cancers. The adoption
of a customized system for NPC in the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 5th
Edition, by the AJCC and the Union for International Cancer
Control (UICC) was a milestone.1,2 The staging criteria were
developed by merging the strengths of the AJCC/UICC, 4th
Edition, and the Ho's System from Hong Kong.3,4 This devel-
opment has gained global acceptance as studies from differ-
ent countries (endemic and nonendemic) consistently
showed substantial improvement as compared with prior
systems. Almost all countries, except China, had adopted
this international system.  
No change was recommended in the AJCC Cancer
Staging Manual, 6th Edition5,6 except for addition of the term
"masticator space" as a synonym for "infratemporal fossa"
(one of the T4 criteria) because although the intended extent
was described in the staging handbook, the latter was not a
clearly defined space with universal acceptance. Both terms
were retained as T4 criteria in the AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition);7,8 however, the term "mas-
ticator space" was described using the boundaries stated in
classical anatomy textbooks instead of the demarcation used
for "infratemporal fossa." Additional changes included
down-shifting of tumors with extension to nasal fossa/oro-
pharynx without parapharyngeal extension (previously T2a)
to T19 and clear definition of retropharyngeal lymph node(s)
involvement (unilateral or bilateral) as N1.10  
The management of NPC has undergone substantial evo-
lution in the past two decades. More accurate imaging meth-
ods have allowed better delineation of tumor extent and early
detection of occult metastases. The advances in radiotherapy
technique has led to increasing conformity of tumor cover-
age and sparing of noninvolved structures. The use of combi-
nation chemotherapy has further improved tumor control and
cure rates, especially for advanced locoregional disease. It is
therefore important that the new staging system be based on
data from patients managed with contemporary methods.  
Extensive literature review showed that there are four
major issues for consideration of improvement: (1) the con-
troversy about the significance of "masticator space",11-16 (2)
uncertainty about the significance of prevertebral muscle
invasion,17-19 (3) the possibility of replacing supraclavicular
fossa (SCF)3 with anatomic nodal "levels,"20-25 and (4) sim-
plification by elimination of unnecessary subgroups.25,26
These suggestions were validated by a large series of patients

therapy from two major centers (in Hong Kong and Fujian,
China),27 before attaining consensus among international
multidisciplinary experts. The strengths of the 7th Edition
and the Chinese 2008 staging system23,24 are incorporated in
developing the staging criteria in this AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition).
