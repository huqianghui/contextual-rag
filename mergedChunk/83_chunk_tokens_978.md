Imaging recommendations for MM differ from those for
other head and neck cancers. T3 disease is defined as mucosa
and immediately adjacent soft tissue. Mucosal lesions often
are superficial and may be evaluated easily by direct visual-
ization and palpation or endoscopy. Superficial mucosal
lesions that are assessed easily and confidently may not
require any imaging. Computed tomography (CT) and mag-
netic resonance (MR) imaging studies can be performed or
reconstructed in planes that are orthogonal to the tumor and
can potentially assess the depth of tumor invasion.  
Imaging can be helpful for lesions that cannot be fully
assessed on clinical examination and for locally advanced
disease or symptomatic patients. Either CT or MR imaging
may be performed for determining soft tissue involvement
(T4a). CT is superior to MR imaging to identify early cortical
involvement, but MR imaging is superior to CT for bone
marrow invasion. Both CT and MR imaging may be used to
evaluate for spread to the masticator, carotid, or pre-vertebral
space (T4b).MR imaging, however, is superior to CT for
identifying involvement of the skull base, dura, or other types
of intracranial extension (T4b). MR imaging also is superior
to CT to evaluate for perineural spread of "named" nerves,
which should be distinguished from microscopic "perineural
invasion." Positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-deoxy-
2[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is not very useful to evaluate
the primary site or locoregional spread. However, PET-FDG
may be helpful to screen for distant metastases in patients with
local advanced disease. The role of imaging in evaluating nodal
metastases is discussed in Chapter 6, Cervical Lymph Nodes
and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and Neck.  
Radiology reports should include information on the
following:  
1\. Primary tumor: primary site and locoregional spread
with specific mention of structures that would change
staging to T4a or T4b  
2\. Status of lymph node metastases  
3\. Presence of distant spread

Margin status and invasion of bone, cartilage, dura, and other
resected tissue should be documented. If a lymph node dis-
section is performed, the number of lymph nodes resected,
the size and number of positive lymph nodes, and the pres-
ence of soft tissue invasion should be noted.#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping  
Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage
grouping.  
#### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care  
As with all cancers, the overall frailty and comorbidities of
the patient are important determinants of prognosis. MM has
few defined disease-specific prognostic factors. The site of
origin in the head and neck is one of the only clear prognos-
tic factors. Disease in the oral cavity has a higher rate of
cervical nodal metastasis than those arising in the paranasal
sinuses. Overall 5-year survival is 15-30% for nasal cavity,
12% for oral cavity, and 0-5 % for paranasal sinus disease.9-11
Other series have demonstrated slightly better outcomes, but
the relative proportion of survival remains best for nasal cav-
ity and worst for paranasal sinus.  
Prasad and colleagues proposed a microstaging system
for MM. They reported that findings of vascular invasion,
polymorphous tumor population, and necrosis conferred a
worse prognosis.12 Others, however, have not confirmed
these findings and suggest high mitotic index and other find-
ings are more salient. At this time, it appears that no clear
prognostic factors exist for MM, although many promising
candidates exist; collection of these data for future editions is
advantageous.  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors, the
overall health of these patients clearly influences outcome.
An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using both
tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart
abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer regis-
trars to obtain important information regarding specific fac-
tors related to prognosis. These data then will be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions.
