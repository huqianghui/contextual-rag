Micrometastases are labeled as pN1(mi), pN2b(mi), or
pN2c(mi) for ≤2 mm deposits detected in single or multiple
nodes detected exclusively on histopathological examina-
tion. These nodes are considered positive for the definition of
pN. Although this designation will not influence staging, it is
recommended for data collection and future analysis of the
impact of incidentally detected micrometastases on
outcomes.

(A) Lymph node with metastatic tumor (T) invading perinodal fat. The
extent of ENE (3.8 mm) is measured (solid bar) from the outer aspect of
the lymph node capsule (C) to the most distant point of perinodal inva- sion (E). A 1-mm bar is shown for size comparison. (B) Higher power

adipose cells (F). From Wreesmann VB, et. al.3 with permission</figcaption>

</figure>Although terms such as extracapsular spread (ECS), extra-
capsular extension (ECE), or extranodal involvement (ENI)
have been used to denote tumor extension outside the cap-
sule of a metastatic node, extranodal extension (ENE) is the
preferred wording.All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined for
the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of ENE
has varied in the literature over the course of time. The College
of American Pathologists defines ENE as extension of meta-
static tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connec-
tive tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.  
Gross ENE that is evident on clinical examination is desig-
nated ENE, and qualifies as ENE(+) for definition of cN. ENE
detected on histopathologic examination is designated as ENEmi
(microscopic ENE≤2mm) or ENEma (major ENE>2mm).
Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for definition of
pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be required for current
pN definition, but data collection is recommended to allow stan-
dardization of data collection and future analysis.  
Tumor deposits in the lymph drainage area of a primary
carcinoma without histological evidence of residual lymph
node tissue may represent a lymph node totally replaced by
metastatic tumor. Such a nodule should be recorded as a pos-
itive lymph node with ENE(+).  
Extent of ENE is defined as the maximal distance in mil-
limeters between the outer aspect of the intact or recon-
structed nodal capsule and the farthest point of invasion into  
the extranodal tissue. Figure 6.4 illustrates the method for
measurement of extent of ENE.
