The meteoric rise in the incidence of high-risk HPV
(HR-HPV)-associated cancers of the tonsil and tongue base
has posed numerous challenges in its diagnosis, management
strategies, and outcomes reporting.1 Due to its unique bio-
logical behavior, the established staging criteria and staging
system reported in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th
Edition (7th Edition), is felt to be inadequate to accurately
define the natural history of this disease.2 This disease occurs
more often in younger, healthier individuals with little or no
tobacco exposure, and has a better prognosis than traditional
HPV-unrelated cancers in this site. HPV16/18 are the most
commonly detected transcriptionally active HR-HPV types.
Immunohistochemistry for p16 overexpression has emerged
as a robust surrogate biomarker for HR-HPV-mediated car-
cinogenesis.3 It is a surrogate marker for HPV DNA testing
because it detects p16 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p16
is upregulated when HPV16 (and to lesser extent HPV18)
oncoproteins degrade p53 and pRB. p16 overexpression is
used as the proxy for HPV-associated cancers. All oropha-
ryngeal cancers should be tested for p16. Those that do not
overexpress p16, or for which p16 testing is not performed,
are staged using the staging system in Chapter 11, the sepa-
rate chapter for p16 negative oropharyngeal cancer.  
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell
carcinoma of the oropharynx (HPV-OPSCC, Table 10.1)
is caused by HR-HPV and originates from the reticulated
epithelium lining the crypts of the lingual and palatine tonsils. It
represents an epidemiologically, pathologically, and clinically
distinct form of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.  
Cervical metastasis of an unknown primary site in level
II/III that is p16 positive with histology consistent with HPV-
mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) also should be
staged with this system. Additional testing for HR-HPV and
