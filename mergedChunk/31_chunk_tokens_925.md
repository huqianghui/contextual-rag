Salivary gland malignancies represent a large variety of his-
tological entities. The staging of major salivary gland malig-
nancies is described in this chapter. Minor salivary gland
tumors are staged similar to squamous cell carcinoma,
according to the site in which they arise (e.g., oral cavity,
pharynx, sinuses, etc.).  
Staging of major salivary gland malignancies is important in
defining their natural history and in predicting prognosis.
The varied prognosis associated with the histological type
also is a major factor in prognosis, in addition to stage, and
should always be taken into consideration when determining
treatment options.4 Because of the relative rarity of salivary
gland cancers and the wide histological varieties, general
principles of staging are used-such as size, involvement of
facial nerve, skin, or sensory nerve involvement-because
these factors have a negative effect on local-regional control
and survival. Nodal involvement also is an important nega-
tive prognostic feature, just as it is elsewhere in the head and
neck.  
A staging system should address and respond to new
information that influences patient outcome. An appropri-
ate balance between complexity and compliance (ease-of-
use) is necessary for worldwide adoption. The TNM system
has strongly predicted prognosis over the years and is
adopted worldwide. The introduction of the new parameter
of ENE better fits the prognostic modeling from large data-
sets. However, it must be balanced by the ability to derive
accurate information from clinicians caring for patients
with head and neck cancer in many different environments.
Thorough descriptions of ENE are included in this chapter.
Effectively, ENE will increase the nodal category by 1 (as
described in the section "Definitions of AJCC TNM").
Although the data for salivary gland are less complete, ret-
rospective reviews suggest ENE is a negative factor and
extrapolation to salivary gland is deemed warranted.The major salivary glands include the parotid, submandibular,
and sublingual glands (Fig. 8.1). Tumors arising in minor sali-
vary glands (mucus-secreting glands in the lining membrane
of the upper aerodigestive tract) are staged according to the
anatomic site of origin (e.g., oral cavity, sinuses, etc.).4

Primary tumors of the parotid constitute the largest pro-
portion of major salivary gland tumors. The parotid is a
paired gland that constitutes the majority of the salivary
gland tissue and thus harbors the majority of salivary gland
tumors, although the majority are benign. Submandibular
glands also are paired and lie on the mylohyoid muscle ante-
riorly and the hyoglossus muscle posteriorly. Relatively
more malignancies arise in the submandibular glands than
the parotids. Sublingual primary cancers are rare and may be
difficult to distinguish with certainty from minor salivary
gland primary tumors of the anterior floor of the mouth.Regional lymphatic spread from salivary gland cancer varies
according to the histology and size of the primary tumor.
Most nodal metastases will be clinically apparent on initial
evaluation. Low-grade tumors rarely metastasize to regional
nodes, whereas the risk of regional spread is substantially
higher from high-grade cancers. Regional dissemination
tends to be orderly, progressing from intraglandular to
adjacent (periparotid, submandibular) nodes, then to upper
and midjugular nodes, apex of the posterior triangle (level
VA) nodes, and occasionally to retropharyngeal nodes.
Bilateral lymphatic spread is rare.Distant metastatic spread is most frequently to the lungs.
