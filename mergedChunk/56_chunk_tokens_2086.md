p16 negative (p16-) squamous cancers of the oropharynx; oropharyngeal cancers without a p16 immunostain performed;
and all cancers of the hypopharynx. Minor salivary cancers and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the oropharynx and hypo-
pharynx. p16 assessment is necessary only for squamous carcinomas. Typically, p16-negative squamous carcinomas are
keratinizing.

#### Histology Codes  
This list includes histology codes and preferred terms from
the WHO Classification of Tumors and the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Most of
the terms in this list represent malignant behavior. For cancer
reporting purposes, behavior codes /3 (denoting malignant
neoplasms), /2 (denoting in situ neoplasms), and in some
cases /1 (denoting neoplasms with uncertain and unknown
behavior) may be appended to the 4-digit histology codes to
create a complete morphology code.
