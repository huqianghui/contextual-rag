The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.21 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medi-
cine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore,
the existing models that have been published or may be in
clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by
the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the
statistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.

<figcaption>Fig. 7.9 Carcinoma should
demonstrate a specific
relationship with nerve, such as
wrapping around nerves, in order
to be classified as perineural
invasion (PNI). Merely
"bumping" into a nerve does
not constitute PNI</figcaption>

Note: A designation of "U" or "L" may be used for any N category
to indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (U) or
below the lower border of the cricoid (L)  
Similarly, clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as
ENE(-) or ENE(+)
