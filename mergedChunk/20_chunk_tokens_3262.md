#### Summary of Changes

<tr>
<th>Change</th>
<th>Details of Change</th>
<th>Level of Evidence</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chapter Title</td>
<td>The chapter title has changed to reflect the focus on all of oral cavity, which includes mucosa of lip but not external (dry) lip.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ICD-O-3 Topography Codes</td>
<td>External upper lip (C00.0), external lower lip (C00.1), and external lip, NOS (C00.2), and commissure of lip (C00.6) have been removed from this classification and added to the classification for cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck (chapter 15). External lip (including the dry vermilion border) has a more similar embryologic origin to skin and its etiology which is often based on ultraviolet (UV) exposure and is more similar to other nonmelanoma cancers.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anatomy - Primary Site(s)</td>
<td>Reference to dry vermilion lip has been removed from definition of oral cavity. Oral cavity extends from the portion of the lip that contacts the opposed lip (wet mucosa) to the junction of the hard and soft palate above, to the line of circumvallate papillae below, and to the anterior tonsillar pillars laterally.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anatomy - Primary Site(s)</td>
<td>Reference to dry vermilion lip has been removed from definition of mucosal lip. The mucosal lip begins at the junction of the wet and dry mucosa of the lip (the anterior border of the portion of the lip that comes into contact with the opposed lip) and extends posteriorly into the oral cavity to the attached gingiva of the alveolar ridge.</td>
<td>IV</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anatomy - Primary Site(s)</td>
<td>Occult Primary Tumor: Staging of the patient who presents with EBV- unrelated and HPV-unrelated metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy is not included in this chapter.</td>
<td>III</td>

<tr>
<td>Rules for Classification - Pathological Classification</td>
<td>For assessment of pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph nodes (previously 10 or more), and a comprehensive neck dissection (radical or modified radical neck dissection) will ordinarily include 22 or more lymph nodes (previously 15 or more).</td>

<td>Definition of Primary Tumor (T)</td>
<td>Clinical and pathological depth of invasion (DOI) are now used in conjunction with size to determine the T category.</td>

<td>Definition of Primary Tumor (T)</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Definition of Primary Tumor (T)</td>
<td>Distinction between lip and oral cavity has been removed from T4a, which is now defined as moderately advanced disease that invades adjacent structures only (e.g., through cortical bone of the mandible or maxilla, or involves the maxillary sinus or skin of the face).</td>

#### Histology Codes  
This list includes histology codes and preferred terms
from the WHO Classification of Tumors and the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
(ICD-O). Most of the terms in this list represent malignant
behavior. For cancer reporting purposes, behavior codes
/3 (denoting malignant neoplasms), /2 (denoting in situ
neoplasms), and in some cases /1 (denoting neoplasms
with uncertain and unknown behavior) may be appended
to the 4-digit histology codes to create a complete mor-
phology code.

*Histology is not ideal for clinical use in patient care, as it describes an
unspecified or outdated diagnosis. Data collectors may use this code
only if there is not enough information in the medical record to docu-
ment a more specific diagnosis.
