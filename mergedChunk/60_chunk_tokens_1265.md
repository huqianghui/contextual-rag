Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional nodal
dissections, followed by pathological examination of the
resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation for
pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected after
radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and consid-
ered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived from
the actual measurement of the unfixed tumor in the surgical
specimen. It should be noted, however, that up to 30%
shrinkage of soft tissues may occur in the resected specimen
after formalin fixation. Pathological staging represents addi-
tional and important information and should be included as
such in staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as
the primary staging scheme.  
For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include
10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical
neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph
nodes. Negative pathological examination of a smaller num-
ber of nodes still mandates a pNO designation.All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined for
the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of ENE
has also varied in the literature over the course of time. The
College of American Pathologists defines ENE as extension of
metastatic tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connec-
tive tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.  
ENE detected on histopathologic examination is designated
as ENEmi (microscopic ENE โค2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be required
for current pN definition, but data collection is recommended
to allow standardization of data collection and future
analysis.#### p16 Immunotesting  
Testing for p16 is mandatory for all oropharyngeal squamous
carcinomas but not for hypopharyngeal cancers. If p16 test-
ing is not performed, that case is staged according to this
system for p16- cancers. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE (i.e., defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk or
phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a sufficiently
high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE(+). AJCC
Level of Evidence: IIIIn addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of these patients clearly
influences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess
prognosis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors
is underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be per-
formed by cancer registrars to obtain important informa-
tion regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These
data will then be used to further hone the predictive power
of the staging system in future revisions. AJCC Level of
Evidence: IIComorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.1ยบ Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful
in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the
clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures along with standard staging informa-
tion. An interrelationship between each of the major perfor-
mance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

</table>Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse negatively
influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in pack-
years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week and
number of drinks per day will provide import
ant data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to
prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss
of>5% of body weight in the previous 6 months.11 Depression
adversely affects quality of life and survival. Notation of a
previous or current diagnosis of depression should be
recorded in the medical record.12 AJCC Level of Evidence: III
