#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping  
Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.  
#### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care  
##### Extranodal Extension  
ENE is defined as extension of metastatic carcinoma within
lymph node, through the capsule, and into the surrounding
connective tissue, regardless of associated stromal reaction.
Histopathologic designations for ENE are as follows:  
· ENEn (none)  
· ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm)  
· ENEma (ENE>2 mm or gross ENE)  
ENEmi and ENEma is used to define pathological ENE
nodal status (Figure 7.4). The distinction between ENEmi
versus ENE, will not affect current pN category, but this des-
ignation is recommended to allow standardization of data
collection and future analysis.  
##### Depth of Invasion  
DOI assesses the invasiveness of a carcinoma, regardless of
any exophytic component. It is measured by first finding the
"horizon" of the basement membrane of the adjacent squa-
mous mucosa (Fig. 7.5). A perpendicular "plumb line" is
established from this horizon to the deepest point of tumor
invasion, which represents DOI. The DOI is recorded in mil-
limeters. Measurements in millimeters can easily be accom-
plished by printing rulers on acetate sheets, which can be
overlaid onto glass slides. Figure 7.6 demonstrates DOI of an
ulcerated carcinoma.  
##### Resection Margins  
The ideal manner of intraoperative margin assessment is
the "specimen driven approach."12,13 Direct discussion
between surgeon and pathologist at specimen hand-off
allows for correct anatomic orientation and identification of
any intra-operative non-margin tissue tears or cuts. The
pathologist maps the specimen, paints the different margin
planes with unique colors, and documents the designations.  
In the event of non-margin tissue tears, these non-margins
should be inked first using a unique color (e.g., yellow).
This obviates the problem of ink running. The pathologist
then makes multiple cuts into the margins at 5- to 10-mm
intervals perpendicular to the resection plane. Initial gross
assessment yields important preliminary information. This
is followed by targeted microscopic examination of mar-
gins of interest. The margin sections should be taken per-
pendicular to the resection plane. The distance between
carcinoma and resection margin should be reported in
millimeters.  
##### Worst Pattern of Invasion  
Worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) is a validated outcome
predictor for oral cavity squamous carcinoma patients in
multivariate analysis.14-16 To simplify prognostication and
enhance adaptation, the only cutpoint recommended for
assessment is whether or not WPOI-5 is present. WPOI-5 is
defined as tumor dispersion of ≥ 1 mm between tumor satel-
lites. With respect to low-stage oral cavity squamous carci-
nomas>4 mm DOI, the presence of WPOI-5 is significantly
predictive of locoregional recurrence and disease-specific
survival (p=0.0008, HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.48, 4.41, and
p=0.0001, HR 6.34, 95 % CI 2.50, 16.09, respectively) and
the probability of developing locoregional recurrence is
almost 42%. Figures 7.7 and 7.8 illustrate examples of
WPOI-5. Tumor dispersion is assessed at the advancing
tumor edge. The most common WPOI-5 phenotype is tumor
dispersion through soft tissue. Dispersed extratumoral peri-
neural invasion, or extratumoral lymphovascular invasion,
also can qualify for classification as WPOI-5.  
##### Perineural Invasion  
Perineural invasion (PNI) should be subclassified as either
intratumoral or extratumoral (Fig. 7.9). Involvement of
named nerves should be specifically reported.17 PNI should
be subclassified as focal or multifocal. Extensive multifo-
cal PNI is usually extratumoral and frequently associated
with a "strand-like" tumor phenotype. The largest nerve
diameter should be reported for multifocal, extratumoral
PNI.  
##### Lymphovascular invasion  
Lymphovascular invasion should be reported as either intra-
tumoral or extratumoral, as well as focal or multifocal.  
##### Overall Health  
In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influences
outcome (Level III). An ongoing effort to better assess prog-
nosis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is
underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed
by cancer registrars to obtain important information

will then be used to further hone the predictive power of the
staging system in future revisions.  
##### Comorbidity  
Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.18 Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful
in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the
clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures, along with stan dard staging informa-
tion. An interrelationship between each of the major perfor-
mance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

##### Lifestyle Factors  
Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be indirectly measured by weight loss of>5% of body
weight in the previous 6 months.19 Depression adversely
impacts quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.20 AJCC Level of Evidence: III  
##### Tobacco Use  
The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is hard
to accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III  
Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.
