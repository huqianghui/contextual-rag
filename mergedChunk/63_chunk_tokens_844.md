</table>The predominant cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The
staging guidelines are applicable to all forms of carci-
noma, including those arising from minor salivary glands.
Other nonepithelial tumors such as those of lymphoid tis-
sue, soft tissue, bone, and cartilage (i.e., lymphoma and
sarcoma) are not included. Histologic confirmation of
diagnosis is required. Histopathologic grading of squa-
mous carcinoma is recommended. The grade is subjective
and uses a descriptive as well as numerical form (i.e., well
differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly dif-
ferentiated), depending on the degree of closeness to or
deviation from squamous epithelium in mucosal sites.
Also recommended where feasible is a quantitative evalu-
ation of depth of invasion of the primary tumor and the
presence or absence of vascular invasion and perineural
invasion. Although the grade of tumor does not enter into
the staging of the tumor, it should be recorded. The patho-
logical description of any lymphadenectomy specimen
should describe the size, number, and position of the
involved node(s) and the presence or absence of ENE.
