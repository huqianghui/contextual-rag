<tr>
<td>Definition of Primary Tumor (T)</td>
<td>TO is added for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive unknown primary with cervical lymph node involvement. The stage group is defined in the same way as T1 (or TX).</td>
<td>III</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Definition of Primary Tumor (T)</td>
<td>Adjacent muscles involvement (including medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles) is now designated as T2.</td>
<td>II</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Definition of Primary Tumor (T)</td>
<td>The previous T4 criteria "masticator space" and "infratemporal fossa" is now replaced by specific description of soft tissue involvement to avoid ambiguity.</td>
<td>II</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Definition of Regional Lymph Node (N)</td>
<td>The previous N3b criterion of supraclavicular fossa is now changed to lower neck (as defined by nodal extension below the caudal border of the cricoid cartilage).</td>
<td>II</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Definition of Regional Lymph Node (N)</td>
<td>N3a and N3b are merged into a single N3 category, which is now defined as unilateral or bilateral metastasis in cervical lymph node(s), larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension, and/or extension below the caudal border of cricoid cartilage.</td>
<td>II</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AJCC Prognostic Stage Groups</td>
<td>The previous Sub-Stages IVA (T4 NO-2MO) and IVB (any T N3, MO) are now merged to form IVA.</td>
<td>II</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AJCC Prognostic Stage Groups</td>
<td>The previous IVC (any T any N M1) is now upstaged to IVB.</td>
<td>II</td>
