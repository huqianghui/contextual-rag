### INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF KEY CONCEPTS

Cancers of the head and neck may arise from any of the
mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract. The
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer
Staging Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition) introduces a num-
ber of significant changes. These include a separate staging
algorithm for human papilloma virus-associated cancer,
restructuring of the head- and neck- specific cutaneous
malignancy chapter, division of the pharynx staging system
into three components, changes to the tumor (T) categories,
addition of depth of invasion as a T characteristic in oral
cancer, and the addition of extranodal tumor extension to
the node (N) category.

Maintaining a balance between hazard discrimination,
hazard consistency, desirable spread in outcomes, predic-
tion of cure, and the highest possible compliance was para-
mount.1 As the world moves toward personalized medicine,
demand will increase for individualized prediction of risk
and outcomes, which may ultimately eclipse the traditional
groupings of cancers used in staging. The complexity asso-
ciated with defining individual risk, prognosis, and benefit
from treatment is undeniable but it may eventually be miti-
gated by relying on computerized algorithms presented in a
user-friendly format on the handheld devices so ubiquitous
in modern society.2 These may be applied through nomo-
grams relying on key anatomic, biologic, and clinical fac-
tors. Nonetheless, a feasible pretreatment approach (i.e.,
clinical TNM) applicable in all medical settings and to all
patients should be maintained both for defining treatment
and for evaluating the effect of treatment across popula-
tions and time. Thus, the 8th Edition represents a compro-
mise between a very accurate, but very complex system
(where compliance would be low) and a very simple
system, which would permit high compliance at the expense
of reduced predictive capacity.

Cancer staging is used worldwide in countries with widely
varying levels of resources. Assuring harmony between the
AJCC and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)
staging systems was an important goal and it could not have
been accomplished without the wisdom, collegiality, and
sense of purpose displayed by members of the UICC Head
and Neck Committee. We are especially indebted to the tre-
mendous work ethic and attention to detail exhibited by
members of the AJCC Head and Neck Expert Panel and its
many subcommittees and disease site leaders. Both groups
have balanced the need for a worldwide system with the need
for incremental improvement.


### KEY CHANGES TO HEAD AND NECK CANCER STAGING

The major changes in the 8th Edition for head and neck can-
cer reflect the changing environment of head and neck oncol-
ogy. The areas highlighted in this section include general
changes and additions to cancer staging that apply across
most Head and Neck sites. The specific changes for each site
are detailed in the respective chapters.


#### New and Restructured Chapters

A major addition is a restructured head- and neck-specific
cutaneous malignancy chapter. This acknowledges the
increasing need for head and neck oncologists to stage cuta-
neous malignancies.

The Pharynx chapter has been divided into three separate
anatomic regions that better reflect the different diseases
arising in the pharynx.

· Nasopharynx has its own chapter recognizing the
unique biology and etiology of this disease.

· HPV-negative oropharynx and hypopharynx remain
together in view of their shared biology and typical
risk factors.

· A new chapter describing the staging of human papil-
loma virus-associated (HPV) oropharyngeal cancers
(OPC) has been added.

The rapidly increasing incidence of high-risk HPV
(HR-HPV) associated cancers of the tonsil and tongue base
has posed numerous challenges in diagnosis, management
strategies, and outcomes reporting.3 The AJCC Cancer
Staging Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition) TNM staging of
OPC tumors lacks hazard discrimination, hazard consis-
tency, and capacity to predict outcome. HR-HPV associated
cancers occur more often in younger, healthier individuals
with little or no tobacco exposure. HPV16/18 are the most
commonly detected transcriptionally active HR-HPV types.
The established staging criteria defined in the 7th Edition are
insufficient to adequately stage and define the biology of this
emerging disease. Immunohistochemistry for p16 overex-
pression has emerged as a robust surrogate biomarker for
HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and as an independent posi-
tive prognosticator in this specific context.4 Direct detection
of HPV is not used as a defining factor due to limited avail-
ability of the test, cost, and lack of additional ability to pre-
dict survival compared with p16 overexpression. p16
overexpression was chosen as the best identifier of disease
because of its low cost, universal applicability, and ease of
reading compared with other HPV identifiers. It is important
to remind clinicians, however, that p16 overexpression is
context-specific and currently applicable only to the tonsillar
and base of tongue regions of the oropharynx. Designation of
p16 overexpression should occur only when there is signifi-
cant staining following established criteria.4 To increase the
utility of staging and acknowledge the emergence of a dis-
tinct disease, the p16+ and p16- OPCs are now separately
described. OPC with p16 expression of weak intensity or
limited distribution (<75% of cells) should be staged using
oropharyngeal carcinoma p16- guidelines.

The 8th Edition TNM staging system for HPV-related can-
cers of the oropharynx provides better discrimination between
stages. T categories remain the same for both p16+ and p16-,
except that the p16+ classification includes no Tis category
and no T4b, and p16- oropharynx, like other non-HPV associ-
ated cancers in the head and neck, includes no TO category.

The p16+ clinical TNM classification is applicable to all
cases before treatment (both surgically and non-surgically
treated cases). The pathological classification is confined to
cases managed with surgery (following examination of the
resected specimens, as with all other pathologically staged
tumors).

A unique and potentially perplexing feature of pathologi-
cal staging in HPV+ is that in the data set, pN3 category

behaves as Stage I while pN2 behaves as Stage II. This find-
ing is unprecedented, and only prospective collection of data
will help clarify this apparent paradox.5


#### Rules for Classification

Because a fundamental difference in outcome was observed
for cases based on the number of nodes confirmed pathologi-
cally and the clinical presence of contralateral nodes and
nodes larger than 6cm, two systems were developed for
these two clinical scenarios. Pathological TNM (pTNM)
applies only if the patient undergoes surgery and uses the
pathological characteristics of the primary tumor and the
number of positive nodes obtained from pathological exami-
nation of the surgically resected tissue. Clinical TNM
(cTNM) utilizes information from available history, physical
examination, and whatever imaging is performed. It is clear
that to accurately enumerate clinically involved lymph nodes
is not possible for a worldwide pretreatment clinical stage
classification; that parameter, therefore, is confined to
pTNM. It is recommended that clinical staging data be col-
lected on ALL patients for the purposes of pretreatment
assessment, providing a uniform standard for comparing
cases across treatment centers around the world and for treat-
ment planning, including selection of postsurgical treatment
and prediction of prognosis.


#### Definition of Primary Tumor (T): Changes

Throughout the head and neck chapters, the Primary Tumor
(T) categories (for size and extent of the primary tumor) are
generally similar, with changes in the skin, nasopharynx, and
oral cavity chapters. A key change from prior editions of the
TNM system is the elimination of the TO category in sites
other than nasopharynx and HPV+ oropharynx. Specific
changes include the following:

· T categorization for skin cancer recognizes the critical
importance of depth of invasion beyond 6 mm and peri-
neural invasion, both of which upstage a lesion to T3.

· In nasopharynx, the previous T4 criteria “masticator
space" and "infratemporal fossa" are replaced by a
specific description of soft tissue involvement to avoid
ambiguity. Adjacent muscle involvement (including
medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and prevertebral
muscles) is designated as T2.

· The biggest change in T category is for the oral cavity.
Depth of invasion (DOI) has been added as a modifica-
tion to T to enhance the distinction between the super-
ficial or exophytic tumors and those that are more
invasive. Clinicians have long recognized the very dif-

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="57" -->
<!-- PageHeader="5 Staging Head and Neck Cancers" -->

ferent biological behaviors between these types of
lesions, and this is now acknowledged by increasing
the T category for every 5-mm increase in DOI in three
categories: less than or equal to 5 mm; greater than
5 mm, but not greater than 10mm; and greater than
10mm). It is important to recognize the distinction
between tumor thickness and true DOI. It has been
recognized since the early work of Spiro and co-work-
ers, in the mid-1980s, that prognosis of oral cancers
worsens as the tumor grows thicker, as with skin
malignancies.6 The somewhat more sophisticated
measure of DOI has been recorded for oral cavity can-
cers since the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 6th
Edition (6th Edition). Clinicians experienced with
head and neck cancer generally will have few prob-
lems identifying a superficial and less invasive lesion
(≤5mm) from those of moderate depth (>5 mm
and ≤10mm) or deeply invasive cancers (>10mm)
through clinical examination alone. Such experts have
estimated the maximum dimensions for complicated
lesions of the tonsil or palate for many years. In apply-
ing the DOI modifier, if there are doubts or ambiguity,
the clinician should apply the general TNM uncer-
tainty staging rule of using the lower attribute for a
category (in this case a lower DOI categorization).

· Extrinsic muscle infiltration is no longer a staging
criterion for T4 designation in oral cavity, because
depth of invasion supersedes it and extrinsic muscle
invasion is difficult to assess (both clinically and
pathologically).

· An additional change is the elimination of the TO cate-
gory for all oral cavity, skin, larynx, HPV- oropharynx,
hypopharynx, and sinus. This change affects cases where
a cervical lymph node has metastatic squamous cell car-
cinoma, but no primary tumor is identified despite thor-
ough history, examination, and available imaging
studies. Assigning these cases to a specific head and
neck site is not possible. Previous editions of TNM stag-
ing included a TO category in each of these disease sites.
However, it is seldom used and, if it is, the cancer could
not be assigned to a stage group. Therefore, for the 8th
Edition, the Expert Panel eliminated the TO category
from the head and neck staging systems. A separate stag-
ing system for those cases with an involved cervical
node without a known primary tumor has been added to
the chapter entitled Cervical Node and Unknown
Primary of the Head and Neck. These cases should be
classified under the TNM rules for a cancer of unknown
primary outlined in that chapter.

· The exceptions where TO continues to be used as a
T-category are HPV-associated cancer and Epstein-
Barr Virus (EBV) associated cancers. For HPV-
associated cancers identified in a cervical lymph

node (defined as p16 positive), the case is staged
using the p16 positive oropharynx system, which
continues to include a "TO" category. EBV-positive
cancers identified in a cervical node with no obvious
primary are staged using the EBV-related nasophar-
ynx system, in which the "TO" category is main-
tained. TO is allowed for salivary gland cancers
identified by their unique histology.


## Regional Lymph Node (N) Category: Introduction of Extranodal Extension

The 8th Edition introduces the use of extranodal extension
(ENE) in categorizing the "N" category for metastatic cancer
to neck nodes. The effect of ENE on prognosis in head and
neck cancers is profound, except for those tumors associated
with HR-HPV.7 Including this important prognostic feature
was considered critical for improving staging.

Most of the evidence supporting ENE as an adverse prog-
nostic factor is based on histopathological characterization
of ENE, especially the distinction between microscopic and
macroscopic (or gross) ENE. For clinical staging only, the
presence of unquestionable ENE as determined by physical
examination and supported by radiological evidence is to be
used. As per the standard rules of cancer staging, if there is
uncertainty or ambiguity for categorization of T, N, or M, the
lower category is assigned.

Stringent criteria for clinical examination must be met to
assign a diagnosis of ENE. Current imaging modalities have
significant limitations in their ability to accurately identify
ENE.8 This mandates that radiological evidence alone is
insufficient. Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE on clini-
cal examination (e.g., invasion of skin, infiltration of muscu-
lature or dense tethering to adjacent structures, or cranial
nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve
invasion with dysfunction) supported by strong radiographic
evidence is required to permit clinical classification of dis-
ease as ENE(+).

Pathological ENE also must be clearly defined as exten-
sion of metastatic tumor (tumor present within the confines
of the lymph node and extending through the lymph node
capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or with-
out associated stromal reaction). Again, when there is doubt
or ambiguity in the reporting, the lesser or lower category is
assigned, in this case ENE(-).


## PRINCIPLES OF STAGING

All staging systems presented in this section are for clinical
staging, based on the best possible estimate of the extent of
disease before initiation of first treatment. Imaging tech-

5

<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

niques-computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and
ultrasonography-may be employed, but clinical examina-
tion is sufficient to assign clinical stage. In advanced tumor
stages, imaging studies add to the accuracy of primary
tumor (T) and nodal (N) categorization, especially in the
nasopharyngeal and paranasal sinuses primary sites, as well
as for regional lymph nodes. Endoscopic evaluation of the
primary tumor and examination under anesthesia when
appropriate may be needed for accurate T categorization.
These may be supplemented by needle biopsy (most often
fine-needle aspiration biopsy [FNAB]) to confirm the pres-
ence of tumor and its histopathologic nature, while recog-
nizing that a negative needle biopsy cannot rule out the
presence of tumor. When imaging studies are not done or
not available, as in low-resource regions, clinical stage may
be based solely on careful history, physical examination,
and/or endoscopy.

Clinical stage should be reported for all cases, as well as
pathological stage when surgery is performed. Any diag-
nostic information that contributes to the overall accuracy
of the pretreatment assessment should be considered in
clinical staging and treatment planning. When surgical
treatment is carried out, cancer of the head and neck can be
staged pathologically (pTNM) using all information avail-
able from clinical assessment, as well as from the surgeon's
operative findings and pathological study of the resected
specimen.

With the exception of p16+ OPC (a recently recognized
disease entity), no major changes in the stage groupings are
recommended. The current stage groupings reflect recent
practices, clinical relevance, and contemporary data. T4
tumors continue to be subdivided into moderately advanced
(T4a) and very advanced (T4b) categories. Stage IV disease
is divided into moderately advanced, local/regional disease
(Stage IVA), very advanced local/regional disease (Stage
IVB), and distant metastatic disease (Stage IVC).

The following chapters present the staging classification
for nine major head and neck sites and disease entities:

· Oral Cavity

· Major Salivary Glands

· Nasopharynx

· HPV-Mediated (p16+) Oropharyngeal Cancer

· Oropharynx (p16-) and Hypopharynx

· Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses

· Larynx

· Mucosal Melanoma of the Head and Neck

· Cutaneous Carcinoma of the Head and Neck

· An additional chapter explaining Cervical Lymph
Nodes and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and
Neck is included for additional clarity and staging
information.


## COLLECTION OF KEY PATIENT AND TUMOR FACTORS

An ongoing effort to evaluate the effect on prognosis of both
tumor and non-tumor-related factors is underway. Cancer reg-
istrars should continue to perform chart abstraction to collect
information regarding specific factors related to prognosis as
outlined in each chapter. These data will be used to enhance
the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions.
Key domains of information to collect include the following:

· Comorbidity: In addition to the importance of the TNM
factors outlined previously, the overall health or presence
of comorbid conditions of patients influences outcome.
Comorbidity can be assessed and semi-quantified using
validated standardized tools applied by review of medical
records.9 Accurate reporting of all major illnesses in the
patient's medical record is essential. General performance
measures are helpful in predicting survival.

· Performance Status: In addition, the AJCC strongly
recommends that the clinician report performance sta-
tus using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance mea-
sures, along with standard staging information.

· Lifestyle factors: Tobacco and alcohol abuse adversely
influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking (in
pack-years) and alcohol consumption (in number of
days drinking per week and number of drinks per day)
will provide important data for future analysis.
However, exactly how these should be incorporated in
staging remains undefined. Smoking is known to have
a deleterious effect on prognosis, but valid data are
insufficient to allow it to be readily introduced into the
staging systems. Smoking history should be collected
as an important element of the demographics and may
be included in Prognostic Groups in the future. For
practicality, the minimum standard should classify
smoking history as follows: never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, > 20 pack-years.

· Nutrition: Nutrition also is important to prognosis and
can be indirectly measured by weight loss of> 10% of
body weight over 3 months.10

· Depression: Depression adversely impacts quality of
life and survival.11, 12 A previous or current diagnosis
of depression should be recorded in the medical record.


## REGIONAL LYMPH NODES

The status of the regional lymph nodes in head and neck can-
cer is of such prognostic importance that the cervical nodes
must be assessed for each patient and tumor. The lymph

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="5 Staging Head and Neck Cancers" -->
<!-- PageNumber="59" -->

nodes in the head and neck are subdivided into specific ana-
tomic subsites and grouped into seven levels for ease of
description (Fig. 5.1, Tables 5.1 and 5.2).

In addition to the standard groups listed in Tables 5.1 and 5.2,
other lymph node groups are defined by their specific anatomic
location. Numbers of nodes are counted toward N category, but
they are listed separately using the following descriptors.

· Suboccipital

· Retropharyngeal

· Parapharyngeal

· Buccinator (facial)

· Preauricular

· Periparotid and intraparotid


### Other General Rules for Assessing Regional Lymph Nodes

Histopathologic examination is necessary to exclude the
presence of tumor in lymph nodes for pathological
categorization (pNO). No imaging study (as yet) can iden-
tify microscopic tumor foci in regional nodes or distin-
guish between small reactive nodes and small malignant
nodes.

<td>Upper Jugular (sublevels IIA and IIB)</td>
<td>Lymph nodes located around the upper third of the internal jugular vein and adjacent spinal accessory nerve, extending from the level of the skull base (above) to the level of the inferior border of the hyoid bone (below). The anterior (medial) boundary is stylohyoid muscle (the radiologic correlate is the vertical plane defined by the posterior surface of the submandibular gland) and the posterior (lateral) boundary is the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoideole. Sublevel IIA nodes are located anterior (medial) to the vertical plane defined by the spinal accessory nerve. Sublevel IIB nodes are located posterior lateral to the vertical plane defined by the spinal accessory nerve. (The radiologic correlate is the lateral border of the internal jugular on a contrast- enhanced CT scan.) The upper jugular nodes are at greatest risk for harboring metastases from cancers arising from the oral cavity, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and parotid gland.</td>

When enlarged lymph nodes are detected, the actual size
(measured as the maximum dimension in any direction) of
the nodal mass(es) should be recorded. Pathological exami-
nation is necessary for documentation of tumor extent in
terms of the location or level of the lymph node(s) involved
and the number of nodes that contain metastases. The patho-
logical presence or absence of ENE should be designated as
ENE(+) or ENE(-).

Note: A designation of "U" or "L" may be used for any N category to
indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (U) or below
the lower border of the cricoid (L).

Similarly, clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as ENE(-)
or ENE(+).


## DISTANT METASTASES

The most common sites of distant spread are in the lungs
and bones; hepatic and brain metastases occur less often.
Mediastinal lymph node metastases are considered distant
metastases, except level VII lymph nodes (anterior superior
mediastinal lymph nodes cephalad to the innominate artery).


## SURVIVAL DATA

No large database registry systems have collected data with
sufficient validation on ENE to demonstrate long-term sur-
vival. However, abundant data support its adverse prognostic
effect.7 The inclusion of ENE in defining the N category
based on these data will allow future validation and modifica-
tion as necessary.

Anatomic sites and histologic types for Head and Neck
cancers are coded according to the 3rd Edition of the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-
O-3). The subsites included in each analysis were chosen on
the basis of those listed in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual,
5th Edition (5th Edition).

Treatment paradigms influence the type and quality of
data available for use in prognostication and staging. Cancers
that are largely treated using nonsurgical modalities (e.g.,
nasopharynx) will obviously not have pathological data
comparable to cancers that are treated surgically (e.g., oral
cavity cancer). Therefore, in these disease sites, parameters
that require pathological examination, such as number of
involved lymph nodes or microscopic ENE, cannot be evalu-
ated in a significant proportion of patients with head and
neck cancer.

Oral cavity cancer represents the most common situation
for which histopathologic data are commonly available for
relatively large numbers of patients and, therefore, is the one
anatomic site that has undergone significant revisions in T
category. Additionally, the N categorization for all sites was

<!-- PageNumber="5" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="62" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

heavily influenced by the data from oral cavity cancer. Oral
cavity cancer outcomes were analyzed using a large data set
of patients treated at two tertiary cancer care centers in North
America comprising patients treated with a common staging
and treatment strategy (Table 5.3).14 Comparable cancer reg-
istry data sets on oral cancer are not available, so these revi-
sions based on single institutional data have not yet been
validated on large populations. The following description of
the process of stage revision of oral cancer vividly illustrates
the importance of high-fidelity data collection and the need
for comparable cancer registry data for future iterations of the
staging system.

The T criteria for oral cancer patients were modified
based on the DOI of the primary tumor, which has long been
recognized as an important predictor of outcome. The basis
for this modification is the report from the International
Consortium for Outcomes Research in Head and Neck
Cancer.14 Outcomes based on the revised T criteria are shown
in Fig. 5.2 and Table 5.4.

The N category criteria also were revised for the 8th
Edition to incorporate the influence of ENE on prognosis.
The preliminary analysis of the influence of ENE on progno-
sis was performed on a data set from the National Cancer
Data Base (NCDB) that included patients treated in 2010-
2011. The data on ENE from other sites also have been pub-
lished widely in institutional data sets and support inclusion
in the 8th Edition (Fig. 5.3).

These new N criteria were then validated using the
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-Princess Margaret
Hospital (MSKCC-PMH) institutional data set (Fig. 5.4 and
Table 5.5).15

After validation of the N criteria, the next step was to
examine the interplay of these new T and N criteria for stage
grouping. The NCDB data could not be used for this purpose
because of the lack of information on depth of information of
the primary tumor. The MSKCC-PMH data set was therefore
used for stage group analysis using 7th Edition AJCC/UICC
criteria (Fig. 5.5 and Table 5.6).15

As seen in Fig. 5.5, the 7th Edition stage groupings
were unable to discriminate between Stage II and Stage
III, an effect that may largely be attributable to the redis-
tribution of prognostic weight introduced by the addition
of DOI and the relatively lower prognostic impact of low-
volume nodal metastatic disease, especially with the addi-
tion of adjuvant treatment. In recognition of these newer
prognostic factors, the MSKCC-PMH data were re-inter-
rogated after appropriate adjustment of the stage groups,
resulting in better discrimination of stage groups (Fig. 5.6
and Table 5.7).

However, these stage groupings could not be validated on
cancer registry data because comparable data on DOI of the
primary tumor and ENE were not recorded for 7th Edition
AJCC/UICC staging. Therefore, although institutional data

that support restructuring stage groups for oral cavity cancer
exist, the stage groupings will remain unchanged pending
future validation.

### Histology Codes

This list includes histology codes and preferred terms
from the WHO Classification of Tumors and the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
(ICD-O). Most of the terms in this list represent malignant
behavior. For cancer reporting purposes, behavior codes
/3 (denoting malignant neoplasms), /2 (denoting in situ
neoplasms), and in some cases /1 (denoting neoplasms
with uncertain and unknown behavior) may be appended
to the 4-digit histology codes to create a complete mor-

## INTRODUCTION

The presence of cervical lymph node metastases is the most
important adverse prognostic feature for most cancers of the
head and neck. However, the degree of impact on prognosis
varies depending on host and tumor characteristics such as
interplay of Human Papilloma Virus-initiation and smoking sta-
tus in cancers of the oropharynx, and the presence of extranodal
extension (ENE) for most other sites. The natural history and
response to treatment of cervical nodal metastases from Epstein-
Barr virus-associated nasopharynx (EBV-related) and HPV-
related oropharynx primary sites are different in terms of their
impact on prognosis, so they warrant separate N classification
schemes. This difference also has led to reclassification of the
TO category (occult primary tumor) based on the EBV and HPV
status of the metastatic cervical nodes. Current understanding of
other nodal features-such as the size of the largest metastatic
node, number of metastatic nodes, and laterality-has improved
based on an analysis of large multi-institutional datasets for oral
cavity cancer. The American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition)
incorporates these data while striving to maintain the balance
between increased complexity and ease of use.

Two major changes are instituted in the 8th Edition for
staging cervical nodal metastasis.

1\. For the first time, different clinical and pathological N
classifications are proposed for definition of regional
lymph node metastasis. This breaks with tradition in
head and neck cancer, although distinct clinical and
pathological classifications have been promulgated for
other tumor sites (e.g., breast cancer). It is helpful to
consider that clinical TNM (cTNM) and pathological
TNM (pTNM) have different purposes. cTNM classi-
fication is required for all patients, including those
undergoing surgery. pTNM classification provides
additional information, but only for patients undergo-
ing surgery; this guides the use of adjuvant treatment
based on factors that become available after histopath-
ological examination of the specimen (e.g., high-risk
features of the primary site, ENE, laterality, and vol-
ume of metastatic nodal disease).

2\. A second significant change is in the use of ENE in
categorizing metastatic cancer to neck nodes. The

<!-- PageNumber="6" -->

<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

effect of ENE in prognosis in head and neck cancers
is profound, except for those tumors associated with
HPV. Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse
prognostic factor is based on histopathological char-
acterization of ENE, especially the distinction
between microscopic and macroscopic ENE. Only
unquestionable clinically evident ENE that is sup-
ported by radiological evidence is to be used for
clinical staging. The guiding principle is to assign
the lesser attribute (ENE negative) if there are doubts
in a particular case to avoid stage migration, in
accordance with the uncertain rule, which articulates
the concept that whenever there is a question, the
lesser stage should be chosen. For clinical ENE, the
known limitations of current imaging modalities to
define ENE accurately demand that stringent criteria
be met prior to assigning a clinical diagnosis of ENE
if the patient is treated with nonsurgical therapy for
neck metastasis. However, unambiguous evidence of
gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion of
skin, infiltration of musculature, dense tethering or
fixation to adjacent structures, or cranial nerve, bra-
chial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve
invasion with dysfunction) supported by strong
radiographic evidence permits classification of dis-
ease as ENEc. Pathological ENE also will be clearly
defined as extension of metastatic tumor (beyond the
confines of the lymph node, through the lymph node
capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with
or without associated stromal reaction). Again when
there is doubt, recall the uncertain rule and assign a
lower stage.


## ANATOMY


### Regional Lymph Nodes

The lymph nodes in the neck may be subdivided into specific
anatomic subsites and grouped into seven levels for ease of
description (Fig. 6.1, Tables 6.1 and 6.2).

Other groups not included in these levels are

· Suboccipital

· Retropharyngeal

· Parapharyngeal

· Buccinator (facial)

· Preauricular

· Periparotid and intraparotid

## RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


### Clinical Classification

When enlarged lymph nodes are detected, the size of the
nodal mass(es) should be measured and their location should
be recorded in terms of the levels of the neck (Tables 6.1 and
6.2). The presence of ENE can be diagnosed clinically by the
presence of involvement of overlying skin, fixity to adjacent
soft tissue, or clinical signs of cranial nerve or brachial plexus,
sympathetic chain or phrenic nerve invasion. The presence of
clinically evident gross ENE is designated cENE(+).

Pathological confirmation of metastasis by a fine-needle
aspirate, needle biopsy, excisional biopsy of a lymph node,
or a sentinel node procedure should be assigned cN.


### The Occult Primary Tumor (TO)

The head and neck region is unique among solid tumor
sites because several different staging classifications are
predicated upon anatomic site of the primary tumor. The
AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition, T classifica-
tions for head and neck sites included TO (primary site can-
not be identified). This concept is not consistent with
anatomic site staging and represents a problem if a primary

tumor cannot be identified on clinical examination and
with currently available radiographic imaging techniques.
This dilemma of the occult primary has been partially
resolved by improved understanding of tumorigenesis and
availability of cytologic and histologic methods to identify
EBV- and HPV-related tumors, which are known to pre-
dominantly arise in the nasopharynx and oropharynx,
respectively. In spite of modern technology, the origin of
the primary tumor does remain unknown in all other
patients whose primary tumor is clinically and radiographi-
cally occult and who present with EBV-negative and HPV-
negative metastatic cervical node(s). Furthermore, TO will
still exist in salivary gland primary sites based on histology
of the lymph node.

Three separate approaches are employed to stage patients
who present with an occult primary tumor. The primary T
category is described as TO and the N category is designated
according to the respective anatomic site based on EBV and
HPV status: (1) patients with EBV-related cervical adenop-
athy are staged according to Chapter 9 (Nasopharynx); (2)
patients with HPV-related cervical adenopathy are staged
according to Chapter 10 (HPV-mediated oropharyngeal
cancer (p16+)); and (3) all other patients with EBV-
unrelated and HPV-unrelated cervical adenopathy are
staged according to the N category described in this chapter.
The stage groupings for these specific patients with occult
primary tumors (TO) take into account the varying prognos-
tic impact of metastatic cervical adenopathy for their differ-
ent diseases. The stage groupings for EBV-related
nasopharynx and HPV-related oropharynx cancer are
described separately in the relevant chapters. Stage group-
ing for the patient with EBV-unrelated HPV-unrelated
occult primary tumor is described in AJCC Prognostic
Stage Groups in this chapter.


### Imaging

Abnormal lymph nodes should be described according to the
level of the neck that is involved, using the standard imaging-
based classification (Table 6.1).

Ultrasonography (US) is a convenient and commonly
used modality for assessment of the neck. However, interpre-
tation is observer dependent and certain areas, such as the
retropharyngeal nodes and mediastinal nodes, cannot be
assessed with US. Currently, its utility is being defined in the
assessment of ENE. Computed tomography (CT) or mag-
netic resonance (MR) imaging can be used for evaluating all
nodal levels for metastatic involvement, with particular
attention to the expected drainage pattern of the primary
tumor site. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission
tomography (PET) may increase sensitivity and specificity
over cross-sectional imaging alone for nodal detection,
although small and cystic nodes may be falsely negative
while reactive nodes may be falsely positive.

A maximum short-axis diameter of 10 mm for lymph nodes
is commonly used to describe abnormal nodes, although this
results in a high false-negative rate. Because size criteria alone
are not reliable, small nodes, particularly in the expected drain-
age levels of the primary site, should be carefully evaluated.
Enlarged or round nodes with loss of normal oval contour and/
or loss of the fatty hilus, and nodes with focal nodal inhomoge-
neity suggestive of necrosis or cystic change should be sought.

Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR imaging) generally
has low sensitivity (65-80%) but high specificity (86-93 %)
for the detection of ENE. US appears to be less accurate in
assessment of ENE than CT and MR imaging, and its utility
is currently being defined. ENE is suggested by interrupted
or undefined nodal contours with high-resolution US imag-
ing. Several CT or MR imaging features suggest ENE, such
as indistinct nodal margins and irregular nodal capsular

enhancement; however, the strongest imaging feature sup-
porting the clinical diagnosis for ENE is clear infiltration
into the adjacent fat or muscle. (Figs. 6.2 and 6.3) This limi-
tation of current technology limits the definitive nonsurgical

diagnosis of ENE to only those patients who have clinically
obvious signs described above. As noted, the presence of
clinically obvious ENE is designated ENE ..


### Pathological Classification

Histopathological examination is necessary to exclude the
presence of tumor in lymph nodes because no imaging study
as yet is accurate enough to identify microscopic tumor foci
in regional nodes or distinguish between small reactive nodes
and small malignant nodes. When a histopathologically
involved node is identified, pN is designated based on mea-
surement of the largest dimension of the metastatic deposit
and not of the entire lymph node.

An excisional biopsy of a lymph node does not qualify
for full evaluation of the pN category and should be
assigned cN.

Pathological examination is necessary for documentation
of tumor extent in terms of the location or level of the lymph
node(s) involved, the number of nodes that contain metasta-
ses, and the presence, absence, and extent of ENE.


### Minimum number of lymph nodes harvested in an adequate neck dissection

For assessment of pN, an adequate neck dissection ordinarily
will include 15 or more lymph nodes in a previously untreated
patient. Examination of fewer tumor-free nodes in a neck
dissection specimen still mandates a pNO designation.


### Sentinel node(s)

Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) are described as the first nodes
directly draining lymph from the primary tumor. SLN biopsy
has been used as a staging procedure for the clinically nega-
tive neck in certain sites, such as oral cancer. Negative histo-
pathological examination of SLNs justifies cNO when
sentinel node biopsy is part of the diagnostic workup and
also is used for pathological categorization (pNO) in those
cases that meet other criteria for pathological staging (e.g.,
resection of the primary tumor). The positive sentinel node
also may be used to classify as pN1, though patients with
positive SLNs usually undergo lymphadenectomy, and pN
status is assigned based on assessment of the neck dissection
specimen if performed.


### Micrometastases

Micrometastases are labeled as pN1(mi), pN2b(mi), or
pN2c(mi) for ≤2 mm deposits detected in single or multiple
nodes detected exclusively on histopathological examina-
tion. These nodes are considered positive for the definition of
pN. Although this designation will not influence staging, it is
recommended for data collection and future analysis of the
impact of incidentally detected micrometastases on
outcomes.

### Terminology for disease extension outside lymph nodes

Although terms such as extracapsular spread (ECS), extra-
capsular extension (ECE), or extranodal involvement (ENI)
have been used to denote tumor extension outside the cap-
sule of a metastatic node, extranodal extension (ENE) is the
preferred wording.


### Definition of ENE and description of its extent

All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined for
the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of ENE
has varied in the literature over the course of time. The College
of American Pathologists defines ENE as extension of meta-
static tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connec-
tive tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.

Gross ENE that is evident on clinical examination is desig-
nated ENE, and qualifies as ENE(+) for definition of cN. ENE
detected on histopathologic examination is designated as ENEmi
(microscopic ENE≤2mm) or ENEma (major ENE>2mm).
Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for definition of
pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be required for current
pN definition, but data collection is recommended to allow stan-
dardization of data collection and future analysis.

Tumor deposits in the lymph drainage area of a primary
carcinoma without histological evidence of residual lymph
node tissue may represent a lymph node totally replaced by
metastatic tumor. Such a nodule should be recorded as a pos-
itive lymph node with ENE(+).

Extent of ENE is defined as the maximal distance in mil-
limeters between the outer aspect of the intact or recon-
structed nodal capsule and the farthest point of invasion into

the extranodal tissue. Figure 6.4 illustrates the method for
measurement of extent of ENE.

Notes:

1\. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes

2\. ENE detected on histopathologic examination is designated as
ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm) or


ENEma (major ENE>2mm)

Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for definition of pN.

Note: A designation of "U" or "L" may be used for any N category to
indicate metastasis above the lower border of the cricoid (U) or below
the lower border of the cricoid (L)

Similarly, clinical and pathological ENE should be recorded as ENE(-)
or ENE(+)

1\. Extranodal extension for all anatomic sites with the
exception of HPV-related oropharynx cancer, naso-
pharynx cancer, melanoma, sarcoma, and thyroid
carcinoma

2\. Size of largest metastatic node

3\. Number of metastatic lymph nodes

4\. Laterality of metastatic nodes; note that midline nodes
are considered ipsilateral nodes.

5\. Level of nodal involvement

6\. ENE clinical (+ or -)

7\. ENE pathological (+ or -)


## SURVIVAL DATA

The data underpinning inclusion of ENE in the staging system
are derived from histopathological examination of neck dis-
section specimens in patients treated surgically for their head
and neck cancer. The modification is based on analysis of a
large National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) data set, including
cases with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,
with the exception of HPV-related oropharynx cancer and
nasopharynx cancer (Fig. 6.5). The new N category was then
tested for validation on another large collaborative data set
from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York,
and Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, for surgically treated
oral cancer patients (Fig. 6.6 and Table 6.3). The lack of ENE
data in patients treated by nonsurgical modalities is problem-
atic because currently available radiographic techniques are

not sensitive enough to detect microscopic or less than gross
ENE. Therefore, only clinically obvious ENE should be used
for definition of cN when the patient is treated with nonsurgi-
cal therapy. This inability of current technology to reliably
identify minimal or microscopic ENE without pathological
examination of lymph node dissection specimens was the
basis for separate cN and pN approaches for staging the neck.
Clinically overt ENE (ENE.) will be designated cN3b irre-
spective of any other nodal characteristic in patients treated
without neck dissection. Histologically identified ENE (ENEmi
or ENEma) in a neck dissection specimen will be used in con-
junction with node size and laterality for pN: Histo-
pathologically confirmed ENE in a single ipsilateral or
contralateral metastatic node 3 cm or smaller in largest dimen-
sion upstages the patient to pN2a, while all other nodes with
histopathologically detected ENE are categorized pN3b.

Up-to-date cancer registry data on the influence of the
new N criteria on outcomes are not available because ENE is
only now being introduced into the nodal staging system.
Limited data are available, however, from the NCDB for
patients treated in 2010-11 for squamous cell carcinoma at
sites other than nasopharynx and HPV-related oropharynx
cancer (Fig. 6.5). The proposed new N classification was
then validated in a large dataset of patients with oral cancer
treated at two tertiary cancer care centers in North America.

## INTRODUCTION

Cancers of the oral cavity continue to represent a major prob-
lem worldwide. The American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition),
makes two significant changes based upon enhanced under-
standing of the behavior of these malignancies.

The first modification is in T categorization incorporating
depth of invasion (DOI). It is important to recognize the dis-
tinction between tumor thickness and true DOI. It has been
recognized since the early work of Spiro and colleagues, in
the mid-1980s, that prognosis of oral cancers worsens as the
tumor grows thicker, similar to skin malignancies.4,5 The
somewhat more sophisticated measure of DOI has been an
oral cancer data element for collection in the National Cancer
Database by accredited Commission on Cancer hospitals
since the publication of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 6th
Edition in 2002. A detailed description of how DOI should be
measured is included in this chapter. It is important to under-
stand that the prognostic influence of DOI interacts with the
greatest diameter of the tumor and that DOI cannot be used in
isolation for assigning T category or for determining progno-
sis. A tumor less than or equal to 2 cm in greatest dimension

may be categorized T2 based upon depth of invasion but such
a lesion does not become T3 as DOI increases, instead passing
directly to T4 with adjacent structure invasion. Similarly, a
lesion greater than 4 cm in greatest dimension but less than 10
mm in DOI will never be categorized T4 (despite its diameter)
unless it invades adjacent structures. Extrinsic muscle infiltra-
tion is no longer a staging criterion for T4 designation because
DOI supersedes it and extrinsic muscle invasion is difficult to
assess (clinically and pathologically). Pathologists should
perform tumor sampling which include sections that specifi-
cally assess DOI, resection margins, and tumor pattern of
invasion. DOI is measured from the reference point of closest
"normal" mucosal basement membrane. Resection margins
should be sampled perpendicular from each plane of margin,
to allow for measurements. Pattern of invasion should be sam-
pled specifically at the tumor/host interface. With respect to
DOI, the guiding principle, if there are doubts, is to select the
less ominous attribute (a lesser DOI) in a given case to avoid
stage migration (according to the so-called uncertain rule of
the AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)
TNM, as defined in Chapter 1).

A second significant change is in the use of extranodal
extension (ENE) in categorizing metastatic cancer to neck
nodes. Any clinical ENE(+) will be designated cN3b.
Pathological ENE(+) will increase pN category by one full
category (from pN1 to pN2 or from pN2 to pN3). The effect
of ENE on prognosis in head and neck cancers is profound,
except for those tumors associated with HPV.5 Including this
important prognostic feature was considered critical in revis-
ing staging. Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse
prognostic factor is based on histopathological characteriza-
tion of ENE, especially the distinction between microscopic
and macroscopic ENE.6-8 Only unquestionable ENE is to be
used for clinical staging (as in the uncertain rule above). For
clinical ENE, the known limitations of current imaging
modalities to define ENE accurately demand that stringent
criteria be met prior to assigning a clinical diagnosis of ENE.
Only unambiguous evidence of gross ENE on clinical exam-
ination (e.g., multiple matted nodes, invasion of skin, infil-
tration of musculature/dense tethering to adjacent structures,
or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or
phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) supported by
strong radiographic evidence permits classification of dis-
ease as ENE(+). Pathological ENE also will be clearly
defined as extension of metastatic tumor (present within the
confines of the lymph node, through the lymph node capsule
into the surrounding connective tissue, with or without asso-
ciated stromal reaction). Tissue sampling should be directed
at the capsule/lymph node interface. Multiple sections may
be necessary for large positive lymph nodes. Again if there is
doubt or uncertainty of the presence of ENE, the case should
be categorized as ENE(-).

A staging system revision should address and respond to
new information that influences patient outcome. An appro-
priate balance between complexity and utility (ease-of-use)

is necessary for universal acceptance. The TNM system for
oral cancers has strongly predicted prognosis and is applied
worldwide. The introduction of two new parameters in oral
cavity staging, DOI and ENE, better fits the prognostic mod-
eling from large datasets. However, it must be balanced by
the ability to derive accurate information from clinicians car-
ing for patients with head and neck cancer in many different
environments. Therefore, thorough descriptions of ENE and
DOI are included in this chapter.


## ANATOMY


### Primary Site(s)

The oral cavity extends from the portion of the lip that con-
tacts the opposed lip (wet mucosa) to the junction of the hard
and soft palate above, to the line of circumvallate papillae

below, and to the anterior tonsillar pillars laterally. It is addi-
tionally divided into multiple specific sites listed below
(Figs. 7.1-7.3).


### Mucosal Lip

The mucosal lip begins at the junction of the wet and dry
mucosa of the lip (the anterior border of the portion of the lip
that comes into contact with the opposed lip) and extends
posteriorly into the oral cavity to the attached gingiva of the
alveolar ridge. The dry vermilion lip and vermilion border is
staged using the chapter on cutaneous carcinoma of the head
and neck (Chapter 15). This is a change from past AJCC edi-
tions where the dry vermilion was included in the lip and oral
cavity chapter.


### Buccal Mucosa

The buccal mucosa includes all the mucous membrane lining
of the inner surface of the cheeks and lips from the line of

contact of the opposing lips to the line of attachment of
mucosa of the alveolar ridge (upper and lower) and pterygo-
mandibular raphe.


### Lower Alveolar Ridge

The lower alveolar ridge refers to the mucosa overlying the
alveolar process of the mandible, which extends from the
line of attachment of mucosa in the lower gingivobuccal sul-
cus to the line of attachment of free mucosa of the floor of
the mouth. Posteriorly, it extends to the ascending ramus of
the mandible.


### Upper Alveolar Ridge

The upper alveolar ridge refers to the mucosa overlying the
alveolar process of the maxilla, which extends from the line
of attachment of mucosa in the upper gingivobuccal sulcus to
the junction of the hard palate. Its posterior margin is the
upper end of the pterygopalatine arch.


### Retromolar Gingiva (Retromolar Trigone)

The retromolar gingiva, or retromolar trigone, is the attached
mucosa overlying the ascending ramus of the mandible from
the level of the posterior surface of the last lower molar tooth
to the apex superiorly, adjacent to the tuberosity of the
maxilla.


### Floor of the Mouth

The floor of the mouth is a crescentic surface overlying the
mylohyoid and hyoglossus muscles, extending from the
inner surface of the lower alveolar ridge to the undersurface
of the tongue. Its posterior boundary is the base of the ante-
rior pillar of the tonsil. It is divided into two sides by the
frenulum of the tongue and harbors the ostia of the subman-
dibular and sublingual salivary glands.


### Hard Palate

The hard palate is the semilunar area between the upper alve-
olar ridge and the mucous membrane covering the palatine
process of the maxillary palatine bones. It extends from the
inner surface of the superior alveolar ridge to the posterior
edge of the palatine bone.


### Anterior Two-Thirds of the Tongue (Oral Tongue)

The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is the freely mobile
portion of the tongue that extends anteriorly from the line
of circumvallate papillae to the undersurface of the tongue
at the junction with the floor of the mouth. It is composed
of four areas: the tip, the lateral borders, the dorsum, and
the undersurface (nonvillous ventral surface of the
tongue). The undersurface of the tongue is considered a
separate category by the World Health Organization
(WHO).


### Regional Lymph Nodes

The risk of regional metastasis is generally related to the
T category as well as worst tumor pattern of invasion
(WPOI). Cervical metastases are uncommon among tumors
with nonaggressive WPOI (types 1, 2, 3) with increasing
likelihood of metastasis for WPOI-4 and WPOI-5. In gen-
eral, cervical lymph node involvement from oral cavity pri-
mary sites is predictable and orderly, spreading from the
primary to upper, then middle, and subsequently lower cervi-
cal nodes. Any previous treatment of the neck, through sur-
gery or radiation, may alter normal lymphatic drainage
patterns and result in unusual dissemination of disease to the
cervical lymph nodes. Cancer of the mucosal lip, with a low
metastatic risk, initially involves adjacent submental and
submandibular nodes, then jugular nodes. Cancers of the
hard palate likewise have a low metastatic potential and
involve buccinator, pre-vascular facial and submandibular,
jugular, and, occasionally, retropharyngeal nodes. Other oral
cancers spread primarily to submandibular and jugular nodes
and uncommonly to posterior triangle/supraclavicular nodes.
Cancer of the anterior oral tongue may occasionally spread
directly to lower jugular nodes. The closer the primary is to
the midline, the greater the propensity for bilateral cervical
nodal spread. Although patterns of regional lymph node
metastases are typically predictable and sequential, disease
in the anterior oral cavity also may spread directly to bilat-
eral or mid-cervical lymph nodes.


### Metastatic Sites

The lungs are the most common site of distant metastases;
skeletal and hepatic metastases occur less often. Mediastinal
lymph node metastases are considered distant metastases,
except level VII lymph nodes (anterior superior mediastinal
lymph nodes cephalad of the innominate artery).


### RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


#### Clinical Classification

Clinical staging for Oral Cavity cancers is predicated most
strongly upon the history and physical examination. Biopsy
is necessary to confirm diagnosis and is typically performed
on the primary. Nodal biopsy is done by fine needle aspira-
tion when indicated. Results from diagnostic biopsy of the
primary tumor, regional nodes, and distant metastases can be
included in clinical classification.

Inspection of the oral cavity typically reveals the greatest
diameter of a cancer, though palpation is essential to assess
DOI and submucosal extension. The mucosal extent of the
cancer usually reflects its true linear dimension. Induration

<!-- PageNumber="7" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="84" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

surrounding a cancer typically is due to peritumoral inflam-
mation. DOI should be distinguished from tumor thickness,
and its determination is predicated on invasion beneath the
plane defined by surrounding normal mucosa. Any exophytic
character should be noted, but assignment of stage is deter-
mined by what transpires at or beneath the surface (defined by
adjacent normal mucosa). Clinical evidence of bone destruc-
tion should be noted and its depth estimated (e.g., into bone
versus through cortex into the marrow space). Thick lesions
often are defined by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging, but the difference between thick-
ness and DOI must be observed. Lesions located near the
midline more often involve the contralateral side of the neck
than well-lateralized cancers. Dysphagia is suggestive of a
tumor with sufficient invasion of oral structures to engender
dysfunction. It is seldom present when cancers have little
DOI. Similarly, drooling or the inability to swallow liquids
without difficulty suggests a tumor with substantial
DOI. Trismus, when not caused by pain, is consistent with a
deeply invasive lesion. Complaints of numbness of the lip
and/or teeth are commonly associated with nerve invasion.
Clinicians experienced with head and neck cancer will gener-
ally have few problems distinguishing less invasive lesions (≤
5 mm) from those of moderate depth (from > 5 to ≤ 10 mm)
or deeply invasive cancers (> 10 mm) through examination
alone. Such experts have estimated the maximum dimensions
for complicated lesions of the tonsil or palate for many years.
However, the distinction between 4 mm DOI and 6 mm DOI
(for example) may not be possible on clinical grounds. A
higher T category should be assigned on the basis of DOI
only if the differences in DOI are clear.

Evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction should be sought
(testing sensation and motion to command) and skin should
be examined for evidence of invasion by underlying nodes.
Palpable neck nodes should be considered in terms of their
location (level in the neck), size, number, character (smooth
or irregular), attachment to other nodes, and mobility. Nodes
that do not move in all directions may be invading nearby
structures. Invasion of the sternomastoid muscle and/or cra-
nial nerves is associated with lateral motion with restricted
ability to move the node along the cranial-caudal axis.
Inability to move the node at all (without moving the head) is
worrisome for ENE, though the suspicion should be tempered
for smaller nodes with limited mobility in level II. Assignment
of clinical ENE should be based almost entirely upon the
physical examination, rather than upon imaging studies; gross
ENE is required to raise the cN category beyond the assign-
ment based upon node size and number, and this may be over-
estimated with current imaging modalities.


#### Clinical or radiographic extranodal extension

ENE worsens the adverse outcome associated with nodal
metastasis. The presence of ENE can be diagnosed clini-
cally by the presence of a "matted" mass of nodes, involve-
ment of overlying skin, adjacent soft tissue, or clinical signs

of cranial nerve or brachial plexus, sympathetic chain or
phrenic nerve invasion. Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR)
generally has low sensitivity (65-80 %) but high specificity
(86-93 %) for the detection of ENE. The most reliable imag-
ing signs are an indistinct nodal margin, irregular nodal cap-
sular enhancement or infiltration into the adjacent fat or
muscle, with the latter finding on CT and MR imaging as the
most specific sign of ENE. Ultrasound appears to be less
accurate than CT and MR imaging, but ENE is suggested by
interrupted or undefined nodal contours with high-resolu-
tion ultrasound imaging. The absence or presence of clinical/
radiologic ENE is designated ENE(-) or ENE(+),
respectively.


#### Imaging

Cross-sectional imaging of the oral cavity may be performed
with either CT or MR imaging, depending on availability,
patient imaging tolerance, contrast allergies, and cost. With
either modality, the coronal plane view-either as direct MR
imaging or from reformats obtained from axially acquired
thin-slice CT-allows excellent evaluation of the floor of the
mouth.9 CT offers some advantage over MR imaging in the
evaluation of cortical bone erosion, although MR imaging
appears to be more sensitive but less specific for the detec-
tion of bone marrow invasion by tumor.10, 11 MR imaging
offers the additional advantage of evaluation of perineural
tumor spread, which for oral cavity tumors is primarily along
the inferior alveolar nerve (CNV3) of the mandible and the
greater and lesser palatine nerves (CNV2) of the maxilla.
Gadolinium contrast is always recommended unless contra-
indicated by prior reaction or very poor renal function.
Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is primarily done
for nodal staging of disease or when distant metastases are
suspected, unless the CT component is performed as a post-
contrast examination with dedicated neck imaging.
Ultrasound does not allow adequate evaluation of the oral
cavity primary tumor site, but it may be a useful adjunct for
estimating DOI and for nodal evaluation with otherwise
equivocal nodal imaging findings.

As small but clinically evident mucosal tumors may be
subtle on imaging, it is important to review the imaging
exam with knowledge of the tumor site. T1, T2, and T3
tumors are distinguished only by size and depth of invasion.
The former is better determined by clinical examination,
although a radiologic measurement should be given as part
of the imaging report. The radiologist's more important role
during tumor staging is to determine deep tissue involve-
ment and assess for nodal and/or distant metastases. T4 dis-
ease entails invasion into adjacent bone, sinus or skin or else
large transverse size (> 4 cm) and greater than 10 mm DOI,
which varies according to the specific subsite of the oral
cavity. For alveolar ridge, floor of mouth, retromolar trian-
gle, hard palate, and large lip tumors, careful attention
should be paid to the cortex and marrow space of the adja-
cent maxilla or mandible, because such invasion denotes

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="7 Oral Cavity" -->

T4a disease. In the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th
Edition, oral tongue tumors were designated T4a when there
was deep invasion into the extrinsic muscles of the tongue
and/or the floor of the mouth. DOI supersedes muscle inva-
sion in the 8th Edition. Depth is frequently better evaluated
in the coronal plane and/or sagittal plane. More posterior
extensive spread of tumor-such as buccal tumors invading
into the muscles of mastication, or spreading to the ptery-
goid plates or superiorly to the skull base-denotes T4b
tumor. Additionally, posterolateral tumor spread to surround
the internal carotid artery is also T4b disease.

Both CT and MR imaging allow evaluation of nodal
morphology to determine possible tumor involvement.
Levels IA, IB, and IIA are the most frequently involved
sites, and these levels should be scrutinized specifically
with concern for rounded contour, heterogeneous texture
including cystic or necrotic change, enlargement, and ill-
defined margins. It also is important to be cognizant that
nodal spread may be bilateral, particularly with anterior
and/or midline oral cavity tumors. Midline nodes are con-
sidered ipsilateral. Skip nodal metastases (level IV without
level III involvement) while described with lateral tongue
tumors, appear to be rare. As previously described, PET/CT
may also be used to improve predictive yield for nodal
metastases by the addition of physiologic information, and
ultrasound may be an additive tool for evaluation of indeter-
minate nodes. PET/CT is the only modality to allow whole-
body evaluation of distant metastatic spread, and the upper
lungs and bone should always be reviewed as potential met-
astatic sites on any staging neck CT or MR imaging.

The risk of distant metastasis is more dependent on the N
than on the T status of the head and neck cancer. In addition
to the node size, number, and presence of ENE, regional
lymph nodes also should be described according to the level
of the neck that is involved. The level of involved nodes in
the neck is prognostically significant for oral cavity (caudad
nodal disease is worse), as is the presence of ENE from
individual nodes. Imaging studies showing amorphous spic-
ulated margins of involved nodes or involvement of inter-
nodal fat resulting in loss of normal oval-to-round nodal
shape strongly suggest extranodal extension; however, path-
ological examination is necessary to prove its presence. No
imaging study can currently identify minor ENE in meta-
static nodes, microscopic foci of cancer in regional nodes or
distinguish between small reactive nodes and small nodes
with metastatic deposits (in the absence of central radio-
graphic inhomogeneity).


#### Pathological Classification

Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional lymph
node dissections, followed by pathological examination of
the resection specimen allows for the use of this designation
for pT and/or pN, respectively. Resections after radiation or

chemotherapy should be identified and considered in con-
text. pT is derived from the actual measurement of the
unfixed tumor in the surgical specimen. It should be noted,
however, that up to 30% shrinkage of soft tissues may occur
in resected specimen after formalin fixation. Pathological
staging represents additional and important information and
should be included as such in staging, but it does not sup-
plant clinical staging as the primary staging scheme.
Metastasis found on imaging is considered cM1. Biopsy-
proven metastasis is considered pM1.


#### Pathological assessment of the primary tumor

Specimen prosection must separately address three issues:
DOI, resection margins, and WPOI; it is best to submit differ-
ent tissue cassettes documenting each prognosticator. DOI is
assessed relative to adjacent normal mucosa. If carcinoma
invades medullary bone, or subcutaneous tissues on gross
examination, then it is categorized as T4 and DOI become
irrelevant. The basic principle of resection margin assessment
is that each tissue plane that meets the surgeon (bone, mucosa,
soft tissue, vessels, and nerve) represents a resection margin
and requires evaluation. Each specimen can be thought of as a
multi-planed manifold; each cut surface from each orthogonal
plane represents a margin surface. Ideally, margin assessment
is performed as a comprehensive intraoperative process. Avoid
parallel shave margins for mucosal/soft tissue assessment. The
pitfall with shave margins is that they may be negative, but if
on permanent sections cancer is present on deeper sections,
the opportunity for measurements is lost. In the context of
intraoperative assessment, the mucosal and soft tissue margins
should be processed first, as these are actionable steps. Then
process further tissue sections deliberately aimed to assess
DOI and WPOI. WPOI sections are harvested from the tumor
advancing edge at the soft tissue interface.


#### Pathological assessment of ENE

Resected positive lymph nodes require examination for the
presence and extent of ENE. ENEmi is defined as microscopic
ENE ≤2 mm. Macroscopic ENE (ENEma) is defined as either
extranodal extension apparent to the naked eye at the time of
prosection and extension >2 mm beyond the lymph node
capsule microscopically. At the time of dissection, extrano-
dal extension can be identified as irregular, firm, white/grey
tumor at the interface with soft tissue. This still requires his-
tologic documentation. The "naked eye" assessment is
important if no residual lymph node structure can be found
microscopically. By contrast, intact lymph node capsules are
smooth, and separate easily from surrounding fat. ENEmi
and ENEma are used to define pathological ENE(+) nodal
status. Stretching of the lymph node capsule by carcinoma
does not constitute ENE; microscopic evidence of breaching
the capsule, with extension into surrounding soft tissue, with
or without tissue reaction, constitutes ENE.

For assessment of pN, a selective neck dissection will ordi-
narily include 15 or more lymph nodes, and a comprehensive

<!-- PageNumber="7" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="86" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

neck dissection (radical or modified radical neck dissection)
will ordinarily include 22 or more lymph nodes. Examination
of fewer tumor-free nodes still mandates a pNO designation.


### PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping

Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.


#### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care


##### Extranodal Extension

ENE is defined as extension of metastatic carcinoma within
lymph node, through the capsule, and into the surrounding
connective tissue, regardless of associated stromal reaction.
Histopathologic designations for ENE are as follows:

· ENEn (none)

· ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm)

· ENEma (ENE>2 mm or gross ENE)

ENEmi and ENEma is used to define pathological ENE
nodal status (Figure 7.4). The distinction between ENEmi
versus ENE, will not affect current pN category, but this des-
ignation is recommended to allow standardization of data
collection and future analysis.


##### Depth of Invasion

DOI assesses the invasiveness of a carcinoma, regardless of
any exophytic component. It is measured by first finding the
"horizon" of the basement membrane of the adjacent squa-
mous mucosa (Fig. 7.5). A perpendicular "plumb line" is
established from this horizon to the deepest point of tumor
invasion, which represents DOI. The DOI is recorded in mil-
limeters. Measurements in millimeters can easily be accom-
plished by printing rulers on acetate sheets, which can be
overlaid onto glass slides. Figure 7.6 demonstrates DOI of an
ulcerated carcinoma.


##### Resection Margins

The ideal manner of intraoperative margin assessment is
the "specimen driven approach."12,13 Direct discussion
between surgeon and pathologist at specimen hand-off
allows for correct anatomic orientation and identification of
any intra-operative non-margin tissue tears or cuts. The
pathologist maps the specimen, paints the different margin
planes with unique colors, and documents the designations.

In the event of non-margin tissue tears, these non-margins
should be inked first using a unique color (e.g., yellow).
This obviates the problem of ink running. The pathologist
then makes multiple cuts into the margins at 5- to 10-mm
intervals perpendicular to the resection plane. Initial gross
assessment yields important preliminary information. This
is followed by targeted microscopic examination of mar-
gins of interest. The margin sections should be taken per-
pendicular to the resection plane. The distance between
carcinoma and resection margin should be reported in
millimeters.


##### Worst Pattern of Invasion

Worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) is a validated outcome
predictor for oral cavity squamous carcinoma patients in
multivariate analysis.14-16 To simplify prognostication and
enhance adaptation, the only cutpoint recommended for
assessment is whether or not WPOI-5 is present. WPOI-5 is
defined as tumor dispersion of ≥ 1 mm between tumor satel-
lites. With respect to low-stage oral cavity squamous carci-
nomas>4 mm DOI, the presence of WPOI-5 is significantly
predictive of locoregional recurrence and disease-specific
survival (p=0.0008, HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.48, 4.41, and
p=0.0001, HR 6.34, 95 % CI 2.50, 16.09, respectively) and
the probability of developing locoregional recurrence is
almost 42%. Figures 7.7 and 7.8 illustrate examples of
WPOI-5. Tumor dispersion is assessed at the advancing
tumor edge. The most common WPOI-5 phenotype is tumor
dispersion through soft tissue. Dispersed extratumoral peri-
neural invasion, or extratumoral lymphovascular invasion,
also can qualify for classification as WPOI-5.


##### Perineural Invasion

Perineural invasion (PNI) should be subclassified as either
intratumoral or extratumoral (Fig. 7.9). Involvement of
named nerves should be specifically reported.17 PNI should
be subclassified as focal or multifocal. Extensive multifo-
cal PNI is usually extratumoral and frequently associated
with a "strand-like" tumor phenotype. The largest nerve
diameter should be reported for multifocal, extratumoral
PNI.


##### Lymphovascular invasion

Lymphovascular invasion should be reported as either intra-
tumoral or extratumoral, as well as focal or multifocal.


##### Overall Health

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influences
outcome (Level III). An ongoing effort to better assess prog-
nosis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is
underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed
by cancer registrars to obtain important information

regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These data
will then be used to further hone the predictive power of the
staging system in future revisions.


##### Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.18 Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful
in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the
clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures, along with stan dard staging informa-
tion. An interrelationship between each of the major perfor-
mance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

##### Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be indirectly measured by weight loss of>5% of body
weight in the previous 6 months.19 Depression adversely
impacts quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.20 AJCC Level of Evidence: III


##### Tobacco Use

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is hard
to accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III

Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.


## RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.21 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medi-
cine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore,
the existing models that have been published or may be in
clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by
the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the
statistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.

## INTRODUCTION

Salivary gland malignancies represent a large variety of his-
tological entities. The staging of major salivary gland malig-
nancies is described in this chapter. Minor salivary gland
tumors are staged similar to squamous cell carcinoma,
according to the site in which they arise (e.g., oral cavity,
pharynx, sinuses, etc.).

Staging of major salivary gland malignancies is important in
defining their natural history and in predicting prognosis.
The varied prognosis associated with the histological type
also is a major factor in prognosis, in addition to stage, and
should always be taken into consideration when determining
treatment options.4 Because of the relative rarity of salivary
gland cancers and the wide histological varieties, general
principles of staging are used-such as size, involvement of
facial nerve, skin, or sensory nerve involvement-because
these factors have a negative effect on local-regional control
and survival. Nodal involvement also is an important nega-
tive prognostic feature, just as it is elsewhere in the head and
neck.

A staging system should address and respond to new
information that influences patient outcome. An appropri-
ate balance between complexity and compliance (ease-of-
use) is necessary for worldwide adoption. The TNM system
has strongly predicted prognosis over the years and is
adopted worldwide. The introduction of the new parameter
of ENE better fits the prognostic modeling from large data-
sets. However, it must be balanced by the ability to derive
accurate information from clinicians caring for patients
with head and neck cancer in many different environments.
Thorough descriptions of ENE are included in this chapter.
Effectively, ENE will increase the nodal category by 1 (as
described in the section "Definitions of AJCC TNM").
Although the data for salivary gland are less complete, ret-
rospective reviews suggest ENE is a negative factor and
extrapolation to salivary gland is deemed warranted.


## ANATOMY


### Primary Site(s)

The major salivary glands include the parotid, submandibular,
and sublingual glands (Fig. 8.1). Tumors arising in minor sali-
vary glands (mucus-secreting glands in the lining membrane
of the upper aerodigestive tract) are staged according to the
anatomic site of origin (e.g., oral cavity, sinuses, etc.).4

Primary tumors of the parotid constitute the largest pro-
portion of major salivary gland tumors. The parotid is a
paired gland that constitutes the majority of the salivary
gland tissue and thus harbors the majority of salivary gland
tumors, although the majority are benign. Submandibular
glands also are paired and lie on the mylohyoid muscle ante-
riorly and the hyoglossus muscle posteriorly. Relatively
more malignancies arise in the submandibular glands than
the parotids. Sublingual primary cancers are rare and may be
difficult to distinguish with certainty from minor salivary
gland primary tumors of the anterior floor of the mouth.


### Regional Lymph Nodes

Regional lymphatic spread from salivary gland cancer varies
according to the histology and size of the primary tumor.
Most nodal metastases will be clinically apparent on initial
evaluation. Low-grade tumors rarely metastasize to regional
nodes, whereas the risk of regional spread is substantially
higher from high-grade cancers. Regional dissemination
tends to be orderly, progressing from intraglandular to
adjacent (periparotid, submandibular) nodes, then to upper
and midjugular nodes, apex of the posterior triangle (level
VA) nodes, and occasionally to retropharyngeal nodes.
Bilateral lymphatic spread is rare.


### Metastatic Sites

Distant metastatic spread is most frequently to the lungs.


## RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


### Clinical Classification

The assessment of primary salivary gland tumors includes a
pertinent history (pain, trismus, etc.), inspection, palpation,
and evaluation of the cranial nerves. Assessment is based pri-
marily on inspection and palpation of salivary glands, skin,
and neck nodes. Biopsy is typically by fine-needle aspiration
or by surgical resection of the tumor. Biopsy results may be
included as part of clinical classification. The presence of
fixation and trismus should be noted. Neurologic evaluation
of all cranial nerves is required, but special attention to the
facial nerve is mandatory. Careful assessment for pain and
hypesthesia of the skin is important.

In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal
mass should be measured. The three categories of clinically
involved nodes are N1, N2, and N3. Midline nodes are
considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior mediastinal lymph
nodes are considered regional lymph nodes (level VII). In
addition to the components to describe the N category,
regional lymph nodes also should be described according to
the level of the neck that is involved. Provide a description or
map of the regional lymph nodes and node groups that the
cancer affects. Unambiguous evidence of gross extranodal
extension (ENE)-which is defined as invasion of skin, infil-
tration of musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clin-
ical examination, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, or
sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunc-
tion-is a sufficiently high threshold to classify these as
clinical ENE(+). Note that the results of a diagnostic biopsy
of regional nodes can be included as part of clinical
classification.

ENE worsens the adverse outcome associated with nodal
metastasis.3,5-8 Cross-sectional imaging using computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) generally has
low sensitivity (65-80 %) but high specificity (86-93 %) for
the detection of ENE. The most reliable imaging signs are an
indistinct nodal margin, irregular nodal capsular enhance-
ment, or infiltration into the adjacent fat or muscle; the latter
finding on CT and MR imaging is the most specific sign of
ENE. Ultrasound appears to be less accurate than CT and
MR imaging, but ENE is suggested by interrupted or unde-
fined nodal contours with high-resolution ultrasound imag-
ing. The absence or presence of clinical/radiologic ENE is
designated ENE(-) or ENE(+), respectively.

Only unquestionable ENE is to be used for clinical stag-
ing. As per the "uncertain rule" of the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International
Cancer Control (UICC) staging, which mandates that the
lower category always be assigned in ambiguous cases, a
case should be categorized as ENE(-) unless there is
unquestionable ENE. For clinical ENE, the known inability
of current imaging modalities to define ENE accurately
mandated that stringent criteria be met prior to assigning a

<!-- PageNumber="8" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="98" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

clinical diagnosis of ENE.9 However, unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion
of skin, infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adja-
cent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction)
supported by strong radiographic evidence permits classifi-
cation of disease as ENE(+). Pathological ENE will be
clearly defined in this chapter. Again, if there is doubt or
uncertainty of the presence of ENE, the case should be cat-
egorized as ENE(-).


### Imaging

Both CT and MR imaging are beneficial and may occasion-
ally be complimentary for staging of major salivary gland
tumors. MR imaging provides better tissue characterization
and is more accurate than CT for properly identifying pleo-
morphic adenomas or acinic cell carcinomas. There is no
defined role of positron emission tomography-CT or other
nuclear medicine studies for the initial evaluation of salivary
gland malignancies. Technetium pertechnetate studies have
been reported to be beneficial in identifying Warthin tumors.
However, the clinical benefit is debatable if biopsy is being
considered.

Both modalities can be used to measure the lesion and
help assess tumor size and extension. Imaging can be helpful
for lesions that cannot be fully assessed on clinical examina-
tion, locally advanced disease, or symptomatic patients.
Both modalities also are helpful in determining if the tumor
has spread through the surrounding capsule of the salivary
gland into the extraparenchymal tissues. Both modalities can
be used to evaluate for carotid encasement. MR imaging is
superior to CT for assessing for perineural spread.
Specifically, MR imaging should be performed to evaluate
for the presence of retrograde perineural spread along the
facial nerve at the skull base, extending through the stylo-
mastoid foramen to involve the mastoid segment of the facial
nerve. CT is superior to MR imaging for early cortical skull
base involvement, but MR imaging is superior to CT for
bone marrow invasion. The role of imaging in evaluating
nodal metastases is discussed in Chapter 6, Cervical Lymph
Nodes and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and Neck.

Radiology reports should include information on the
following:

1\. Primary Tumor: Primary site and local spread, with
specific mention of structures that would change stag-
ing to T4a or T4b

2\. Status of lymph node metastases

3\. Presence of distant spread


### Pathological Classification

Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional nodal
dissections, followed by pathological examination of the
resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation for

pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected after
radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and consid-
ered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived from
the actual measurement of the unfixed tumor in the surgical
specimen. It should be noted, however, that up to 30%
shrinkage of soft tissues may occur in resected specimen
after formalin fixation. Pathological staging represents addi-
tional and important information and should be included as
such in staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as
the primary staging scheme.

For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include
10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical
neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph
nodes. Negative pathological examination of a smaller num-
ber of nodes still mandates a pNO designation.


### Definition of ENE and Description of Its Extent

All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined
for the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of
ENE has varied in the literature over time. The American
College of Pathologists defines ENE as extension of meta-
static tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding con-
nective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.
Gross ENE (Eg) is defined as tumor apparent to the naked
eye beyond the confines of the nodal capsule. Microscopic
ENE (Em) is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, pres-
ent within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Only gross ENE is used
to define pathological ENE(+) nodal status.

ENE detected on histopathologic examination is desig-
nated as ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be
required for current pN definition, but data collection is rec-
ommended to allow standardization of data collection and
future analysis.


## PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


### Prognostic Factors Required For Stage Grouping

Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.


### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care


#### Extranodal Extension

ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="99" -->
<!-- PageHeader="8 Major Salivary Glands" -->

without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE (defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk
or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a sufficiently
high threshold to classify these tumors as clinical ENE(+).
AJCC Level of Evidence: III


#### Overall Health

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influ-
ences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess progno-
sis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is
underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be performed
by cancer registrars to obtain important information
regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These data
then will be used to further hone the predictive power of
the staging system in future revisions. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III


#### Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.1º Accurate reporting of all ill-
nesses in the patient's medical record is essential to
assessment of these parameters. General performance mea-
sures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly
recommends the clinician report performance status using
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod,
or Karnofsky performance measures, along with standard
staging information. An interrelationship between each of
the major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of
Evidence: II


<table>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">Zubrod/ECOG Performance Scale</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>Fully active, able to carry on all predisease activities without restriction (Karnofsky 90-100)</td>

<td>Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature; for example, light housework, office work (Karnofsky 70-80)</td>

<td>Completely disabled; cannot carry on self-care; totally confined to bed or chair (Karnofsky 10-20)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Death (Karnofsky 0)</td>
</tr>
</table>


#### Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be measured indirectly by weight loss of>5% of body

weight in the previous 6 months.11 Depression adversely
affects quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.12 AJCC Level of Evidence: III


#### Tobacco Use

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. Exactly how this could be codified in the staging
system, however, is less clear. At this time, smoking is known
to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is difficult to
accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III

Smoking history should be collected as an important
element of the demographics and may be included in
Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the mini-
mum standard should classify smoking history as never, ≤
10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack years.


### RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used to
evaluate published statistical prediction models for the pur-
pose of granting endorsement for clinical use.13 Although this
is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medicine, this
work was published only very recently. Therefore, the existing
models that have been published or may be in clinical use have
not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by the Precision
Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the statistical pre-
diction models for this cancer site will be evaluated, and those
that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.

### HISTOLOGIC GRADE (G)

There is no uniform grading system for salivary gland.


### HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE

The exact classification of salivary tumors can be challeng-
ing, especially in limited material, given the potential for
phenotypic overlap.14 The histology table in this chapter
reflects the 2017 World Health Organization classification of
salivary malignancies. Some tumors are routinely graded by
three-tiered schema, some by two-tiered schema, some may
develop a "dedifferentiated" or abrupt high-grade transfor-
mation, and others are not graded. Ductal carcinomas are
modified by the presence or absence of invasion plus grade.
The additional criteria of "minimally invasive" is a modifier
for carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.

### Histology Codes

This list includes histology codes and preferred terms from
the WHO Classification of Tumors and the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Most of
the terms in this list represent malignant behavior. For cancer
reporting purposes, behavior codes /3 (denoting malignant
neoplasms), /2 (denoting in situ neoplasms), and in some
cases /1 (denoting neoplasms with uncertain and unknown
behavior) may be appended to the 4-digit histology codes to
create a complete morphology code.

## INTRODUCTION

An accurate staging system is crucial in cancer management
for predicting prognosis, guiding clinicians in treatment
decisions for different risk groups, and sharing experience on
results of treatment between centers. Prognostic significance
of staging system changes with advances in investigation and
treatment methods. Evaluation of staging systems to ensure

continual suitability and exploration for further improve-
ment is essential.

This chapter focuses on TNM staging for epithelial
tumors of the nasopharynx. Nonepithelial tumors such as
mucosal melanoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma of soft tissue,
bone, and cartilage are not included. Nasopharyngeal carci-
noma (NPC) has a very skewed geographic and ethnic distri-
bution, with 80% of the global burden in Asian countries.
The natural behavior and therapeutic consideration for NPC
are different from other head and neck cancers. The adoption
of a customized system for NPC in the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 5th
Edition, by the AJCC and the Union for International Cancer
Control (UICC) was a milestone.1,2 The staging criteria were
developed by merging the strengths of the AJCC/UICC, 4th
Edition, and the Ho's System from Hong Kong.3,4 This devel-
opment has gained global acceptance as studies from differ-
ent countries (endemic and nonendemic) consistently
showed substantial improvement as compared with prior
systems. Almost all countries, except China, had adopted
this international system.

No change was recommended in the AJCC Cancer
Staging Manual, 6th Edition5,6 except for addition of the term
"masticator space" as a synonym for "infratemporal fossa"
(one of the T4 criteria) because although the intended extent
was described in the staging handbook, the latter was not a
clearly defined space with universal acceptance. Both terms
were retained as T4 criteria in the AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition);7,8 however, the term "mas-
ticator space" was described using the boundaries stated in
classical anatomy textbooks instead of the demarcation used
for "infratemporal fossa." Additional changes included
down-shifting of tumors with extension to nasal fossa/oro-
pharynx without parapharyngeal extension (previously T2a)
to T19 and clear definition of retropharyngeal lymph node(s)
involvement (unilateral or bilateral) as N1.10

The management of NPC has undergone substantial evo-
lution in the past two decades. More accurate imaging meth-
ods have allowed better delineation of tumor extent and early
detection of occult metastases. The advances in radiotherapy
technique has led to increasing conformity of tumor cover-
age and sparing of noninvolved structures. The use of combi-
nation chemotherapy has further improved tumor control and
cure rates, especially for advanced locoregional disease. It is
therefore important that the new staging system be based on
data from patients managed with contemporary methods.

Extensive literature review showed that there are four
major issues for consideration of improvement: (1) the con-
troversy about the significance of "masticator space",11-16 (2)
uncertainty about the significance of prevertebral muscle
invasion,17-19 (3) the possibility of replacing supraclavicular
fossa (SCF)3 with anatomic nodal "levels,"20-25 and (4) sim-
plification by elimination of unnecessary subgroups.25,26
These suggestions were validated by a large series of patients

who were staged with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
and treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy ±chemo-
therapy from two major centers (in Hong Kong and Fujian,
China),27 before attaining consensus among international
multidisciplinary experts. The strengths of the 7th Edition
and the Chinese 2008 staging system23,24 are incorporated in
developing the staging criteria in this AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition).


## ANATOMY


### Primary Site(s)

The pharynx is divided into three regions: nasopharynx, oro-
pharynx, and hypopharynx (Fig. 9.1). The specific anatomic
site of nasopharynx and regional lymphatics are described in
this section.

The nasopharynx begins anteriorly at the posterior cho-
ana and extends along the plane of the airway to the level of
the free border of the soft palate. It includes the superior
wall, the posterior wall, and the lateral walls, which include

the fossae of Rosenmuller and the mucosa covering the torus
tubaris forming the Eustachian tube orifice. The floor is the
superior surface of the soft palate. The posterior margins of
the choanal orifices and of the nasal septum are included in
the nasal fossa.

Nasopharyngeal tumors extending to the nasal cavity or
oropharynx in the absence of parapharyngeal space involve-
ment do not have a significantly worse outcome than tumors
confined to the nasopharynx. Involvement of the parapharyn-
geal space is defined as posterolateral infiltration from the
nasopharynx beyond the buccopharyngeal fascia into the
triangular space lateral to the pharynx.


### Regional Lymph Nodes

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma often presents with early lym-
phatic spread. The retropharyngeal nodes and the cervical
nodes (both jugular and spinal accessory chains) are involved,
often bilaterally. The lymphatic spread in NPC follows a
predictable and orderly pattern from upper to lower neck;
"skip" metastasis is rare.21,28

<!-- PageNumber="9" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="106" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

In clinical evaluation, the maximum dimension (in any
direction) of the nodal mass, the laterality, and the lowest
level of neck involvement should be assessed. Midline nodes
are considered ipsilateral nodes. Nodal size larger than 6 cm
in greatest dimension and/or extension below the caudal bor-
der of the cricoid cartilage are associated with the worst
prognosis.


### Metastatic Sites

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is notorious for a high risk of dis-
tant metastasis. The most common sites include lung, bone,
liver, and distant lymph nodes. Involvement of lymph nodes
below the clavicle (including mediastinum, infraclavicular
region, axilla, or groin) is considered as distant metastases.


## RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


### Clinical Classification

Clinical staging is employed for NPC. Assessment is based
primarily on thorough history, physical examination, indirect
or direct endoscopy, and imaging. Physical examination
should include neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves,
palpation of neck nodes (greatest dimension, laterality, loca-
tion, and lowest extent of nodal involvement), and exclusion
of gross signs of distant metastases. Indirect or direct endos-
copy should assess the extent of anterior involvement into
the nasal cavities and inferior infiltration into the oropharynx
and hypopharynx. Biopsy should be taken for histological
confirmation. Routine testing for complete blood picture,
renal, and liver functions (including alkaline phosphatase)
are indicated.


### Imaging

Cross-sectional imaging studies covering the nasopharyn-
geal and cervical regions are essential for clinical staging of
NPC. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the study of
choice because of its multiplanar capability, superior soft tis-
sue contrast, and sensitivity for detecting skull base and
intracranial tumor spread. Computed tomography (CT)
imaging with axial and coronal thin section technique with
contrast is an alternative. Regional nodal status (greatest
dimension in any direction, laterality, location, and lowest
extent of nodal involvement) should be assessed; measure-
ment of the maximal diameter of nodal disease should not be
confined to the axial radiological plane only.

Metastatic workup is recommended for patients with node-
positive or locally advanced (T3-4) disease, those with symp-

toms, signs, and/or biochemical tests suggestive of distant
metastasis. Whole body 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)
positron emission tomography (PET) coupled with CT is
increasingly used because of its sensitivity for detecting distant
metastases and second primary malignancy, the possibility of
its supplementing MR imaging in assessing nodal status,29 and
its use of the maximal standard uptake values (SUVmax) as an
additional independent prognostic predictor.30,31 Assessment
by CT thorax and upper abdomen (or chest X-ray and abdomi-
nal ultrasound) and bone scan is an alternative.


## PATHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION

Unlike other head and neck cancer, NPC is primarily treated
by radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, with no
resection of the primary cancer. This makes pathological
classification largely irrelevant. Surgery to primary or neck
nodes is used only for recurrence.


## PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping

Although additional factors may contribute to refining prog-
nostication, none have an adequate level of evidence and
consistent cut-off value that attain consensus for incorpora-
tion as staging criteria.


### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care


#### Overall Health

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors, the overall
health of these patients clearly influences outcome. An ongo-
ing effort to better assess prognosis using both tumor and
nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart abstraction will
continue to be performed by cancer registrars to obtain
important information regarding specific factors related to
prognosis. These data will then be used to further hone the
predictive power of the staging system in future revisions.
AJCC Level of Evidence: II


#### Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all illnesses in
the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="107" -->
<!-- PageHeader="9 Nasopharynx" -->

in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends that
the clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures, along with standard staging informa-
tion. An interrelationship between each of the major perfor-
mance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II


<table>

</tr>

<td>4</td>
<td>Completely disabled. Cannot carry out self-care. Totally confined to bed. (Karnofsky 10-20)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Death (Karnofsky 0)</td>
</tr>
</table>


#### Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be indirectly measured by weight loss of>10% of body
weight. Depression adversely impacts quality of life and sur-
vival. Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depres-
sion should be recorded in the medical record. AJCC Level
of Evidence: III

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard to
accurately apply to the staging system. Smoking history
should be collected as an important element of the demo-
graphics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the
future. For practicality, the minimum standard should clas-
sify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤20
pack-years, or>20 pack-years.


### RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.32 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision
medicine, this work was published only very recently.
Therefore, the existing models that have been published or

may be in clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this
cancer site by the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In
the future, the statistical prediction models for this cancer
site will be evaluated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria
will be endorsed.

## INTRODUCTION

The meteoric rise in the incidence of high-risk HPV
(HR-HPV)-associated cancers of the tonsil and tongue base
has posed numerous challenges in its diagnosis, management
strategies, and outcomes reporting.1 Due to its unique bio-
logical behavior, the established staging criteria and staging
system reported in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th
Edition (7th Edition), is felt to be inadequate to accurately
define the natural history of this disease.2 This disease occurs
more often in younger, healthier individuals with little or no
tobacco exposure, and has a better prognosis than traditional
HPV-unrelated cancers in this site. HPV16/18 are the most
commonly detected transcriptionally active HR-HPV types.
Immunohistochemistry for p16 overexpression has emerged
as a robust surrogate biomarker for HR-HPV-mediated car-
cinogenesis.3 It is a surrogate marker for HPV DNA testing
because it detects p16 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. p16
is upregulated when HPV16 (and to lesser extent HPV18)
oncoproteins degrade p53 and pRB. p16 overexpression is
used as the proxy for HPV-associated cancers. All oropha-
ryngeal cancers should be tested for p16. Those that do not
overexpress p16, or for which p16 testing is not performed,
are staged using the staging system in Chapter 11, the sepa-
rate chapter for p16 negative oropharyngeal cancer.

Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related squamous cell
carcinoma of the oropharynx (HPV-OPSCC, Table 10.1)
is caused by HR-HPV and originates from the reticulated
epithelium lining the crypts of the lingual and palatine tonsils. It
represents an epidemiologically, pathologically, and clinically
distinct form of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Cervical metastasis of an unknown primary site in level
II/III that is p16 positive with histology consistent with HPV-
mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) also should be
staged with this system. Additional testing for HR-HPV and

Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBER) by in situ
hybridization is recommended to confirm HPV mediation
and to exclude Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) origin, which sug-
gests nasopharyngeal origin. The "TO" category has been
eliminated for most head and neck squamous cell cancers,
and those with cervical nodes without a known primary can-
cer are staged using the cervical node system. However,
cases of HPV-associated (p16 positive cancers) cervical node
with no apparent primary are an exception. These cases are
staged using the system defined in this chapter and using the
"TO" category.

Current TNM staging of HPV-related OPC tumors is non-
discriminating due to the unique nature of the disease. To
enhance the accuracy reflecting the biological behavior of
these cancers and to increase utility of staging, OPC staging
will be separately described as either p16 overexpressing
(p16+), or p16 negative (p16-). The most common scenario
is that p16+ is either diffuse and strong, or entirely negative.
Scientific literature has demonstrated that the cut point for
determining p16+ by immunohistochemistry is strong dif-
fuse expression (+2/+3 intensity and ≥ 75% distribution,
Fig. 10.1). The College of American Pathologists (CAP) has
suggested a similar distribution cut point of > 70%.4 As the
difference between 70% and 75% is trivial and cannot be
visually discriminated, we revise this cut point to 70% in
order to harmonize with the CAP Cancer Protocols. All
agree that nuclear staining is requisite. Oropharyngeal can-
cers with p16 expression of weak intensity or limited distri-
bution should be staged using OPC p16- guidelines (see


<figure>
<figcaption>Fig. 10.1 In the context of oropharyngeal cancer, the optimal cut-off
for p16 overexpression as a surrogate HR-HPV biomarker is ≥+2/+3
nuclear staining intensity (+/- cytoplasmic staining) with ≥ 75% distri-
bution.5 (a) The typical p16 overexpression phenotype is greater than
this threshold. Here diffuse, robust nuclear and cytoplasmic overexpres- sion is seen. (b) A rarer positive pattern is that of p16 overexpression
limited to nuclei. (c) Nonspecific cytoplasmic p16 expression is usually
associated with limited staining distribution. Carcinomas with this
staining pattern are excluded from this chapter</figcaption>

Chapter 11). Additionally, p16+ presently is considered only
for oropharyngeal cancer; the role of p16+ at other anatomic
sites is unclear as yet. Direct detection of HPV will not be
used as a defining factor due to its difficulty in universal
availability and applicability, cost, and failure to stratify sur-
vival as well as p16 overexpression.

A staging system that recognizes the rising incidence of
epidemic proportions of HPV-related cancers of the oro-
pharynx is needed for better discrimination between stages.
T categories will remain the same as traditional OPC for
both p16+ and p16-, except that the p16+ classification will
not include a Tis category, and there will not be a T4b
within T4.

Like all other pathologically staged tumors, p16+ also has
a clinical TNM classification applicable to all cases before
treatment (surgically and nonsurgically treated cases) and a
pathological classification confined to cases managed with
surgery following examination of the primary tumor and
neck dissection specimens.


## ANATOMY


### Primary Site(s)

The oropharynx is the portion of the continuity of the
pharynx extending from the plane of the superior surface
of the soft palate to the superior surface of the hyoid
bone (or vallecula). It includes the base of the tongue,
including the lingual tonsil; the inferior (anterior) surface
of the soft palate and the uvula; the anterior and posterior
tonsillar pillars with the palatine tonsils; the glossoton-
sillar sulci; and the lateral and posterior pharyngeal
walls. (Fig. 10.2)

HPV-mediated cancers most commonly arise in the lym-
phatic tissue of the palatine and lingual tonsil but may arise
in any of the regions of the oropharynx.


### Regional Lymph Nodes

Oropharyngeal cancers usually involve upper and midjugu-
lar lymph nodes and (less commonly) submental/subman-
dibular nodes. Base-of-tongue cancers commonly manifest
bilateral lymphatic drainage.

Unknown primary (TO) nodal positive disease should be
staged using this section if a node is p16+ and no primary
site is identified.


### Metastatic Sites

The most common site of distant metastasis is the lung
followed by bone.


## RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


### Clinical Classification

Clinical stage is based on reports from a large dataset from five
North American and two European Centers, the International
Collaboration for Oropharyngeal Cancer Network for Staging
(ICON-S). The ICON-S is a validation study following the
Princess Margaret Hospital report and contains approximately
3,000 cases, about 2,000 of which are HPV+.6

This study showed that traditional NO to N2b nodal stages
are homogeneous for outcome within T1 and T2 categories

<!-- PageNumber="10" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="116" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

(creating Stage I). N2c and T3 have an intermediate stage
(Stage II), and T4 and N3 are the least favorable group (Stage
III). Stage IV is reserved for distant metastases. T categories
are the same for clinical and pathological staging.

Clinical staging is generally employed for squamous
cell carcinomas of the pharynx. Assessment is based pri-
marily on inspection: indirect and direct endoscopy, as well
as imaging. Palpation of sites (when feasible) and of neck
nodes is essential. Diagnostic biopsy of the primary and/or
distant metastatic sites and the neck are part of clinical
staging. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is
required.

In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal
mass should be measured. There are three categories of
clinically involved nodes for the oropharynx: N1, N2, and
N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior
mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph
nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to describe
the N category, regional lymph nodes also should be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
Provide a description or map of the regional lymph nodes
and node groups that the cancer affects. The role of extrano-
dal extension is less obvious in p16+ oropharyngeal cancer.
It is not a factor in staging this disease.


### Imaging

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is often the
first imaging study of choice with a new neck mass that is
suspected to be adenopathy, or when either metastatic nodal
disease or a primary oropharyngeal tumor is detected.
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the alternate cross-
sectional modality which may be employed for initial stag-
ing, post-treatment evaluation or surveillance. Both
modalities allow excellent evaluation of the primary oropha-
ryngeal tumor and of nodal drainage sites. Positron emission
tomography (PET)/CT is being used with greater frequency
for staging, treatment evaluation, and surveillance. It may
offer an advantage in the detection of an otherwise clinically
occult primary tumor and in exclusion of a viable tumor in
residual enlarged nodes after chemoradiation.

Imaging staging of a known oropharyngeal tumor requires
a systematic review of the primary tumor, nodal drainage
sites, and imaged potential sites of spread. For this purpose,
structured reporting may offer advantages to the radiologist
for ensuring that critical information is not omitted.


### Primary tumor

The subsite of the oropharynx should be clarified (palatine/
lingual tonsil, tonsillar pillar, posterior pharyngeal wall, soft
palate). The size of the primary tumor should be measured
along its longest diameter to determine whether this is T1
(≤2 cm), T2 (>2 cm and ≤4 cm) or T3 (>4 cm). It may be
difficult to be certain by imaging whether a base-of-tongue
tumor is extending along the mucosal surface of the lingual

aspect of the epiglottis (also T3) or whether the exophytic
tumor is abutting against this surface. In these situations,
clarification by direct clinical observation is essential. T4
disease is determined by invasion (1) anteriorly to the extrin-
sic muscles of the tongue in the floor of the mouth or from
the soft palate anteriorly to the hard palate, (2) laterally into
the pterygoid muscles or mandible, (3) inferiorly to the lar-
ynx, or (4) superiorly to the skull base or beyond. Skull base
involvement also necessitates careful evaluation for perineu-
ral and intracranial spread of the tumor. Description of the
extent of invasion of these specific structures with T4 tumors
is important for radiation planning and should be clearly
articulated in the report.

CT and MR imaging afford some view of the lungs for
metastases, albeit with only a small volume of the lungs
being imaged and with low sensitivity for MR imaging. A
complete staging report includes evaluation of the lung
apices for potential metastases and of the bones of the
skull and cervical spine for metastatic disease. PET/CT
allows more accurate and complete evaluation for distant
metastatic disease, which is most often to the lung, bone,
and liver with HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma
(SCCa).

Specific pitfalls in imaging relate to the imaging modality
being used or to strict interpretation of the definitions of
tumor involvement. Detection of metastatic involvement of
nodes with either CT or MR imaging requires careful evalu-
ation of multiple morphological features: size, shape, density
(intensity on MR imaging), necrosis, and extranodal exten-
sion of tumor. It is important to review all criteria and not
merely the size of a lymph node. This also should be per-
formed in conjunction with knowledge of the expected drain-
age pattern of the tumor. As stated previously, oropharyngeal
tumors most often drain to the upper- and midjugular nodes
(levels II and III, respectively), and bilateral drainage is fre-
quent. These nodal sites should be scrutinized carefully for
abnormal shape, size, contour, and texture. The retropharyn-
geal nodes (RPN) also should be evaluated, particularly
when a posterior pharyngeal wall tumor is present. Keep in
mind that unless cystic or necrotic, RPN frequently appear
isodense to the adjacent prevertebral muscles on CT, making
them readily overlooked.

A common pitfall of PET/CT that is particularly pertinent
to the evaluation of HPV-related SCCa is the absence of ele-
vated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in cystic nodes. For
this reason, it is imperative that the CT component of the
staging examination be carefully evaluated for cystic (low-
density) nodes, which have too little solid tissue to demon-
strate elevated FDG activity. With this in mind, PET/CT for
head and neck malignancies are best performed with
contrast-enhanced CT portions of the examination and pref-
erably with dedicated smaller field of view (FOV) neck
images. When iodinated contrast is not employed for PET/
CT, it also is difficult to evaluate for specific sites of disease

involvement, which might upstage a tumor. For example,
determining the presence of medial or lateral pterygoid mus-
cle involvement (both T4) by a tonsillar carcinoma is diffi-
cult when relying on noncontrast large FOV CT for
correlation with FDG-PET uptake.

Some subtleties of tumor involvement for staging also
require clarification. The palatoglossus muscle forms the
muscle bulk of the anterior tonsillar pillar and may be
invaded with even a relatively small tonsillar or tonsillar pil-
lar tumor. Although palatoglossus is defined as an extrinsic
muscle of the tongue, involvement of this muscle within the
oropharynx does not denote a significantly poorer prognosis
for the patient and does not change the T category. A final
imaging pitfall for consideration is during the imaging evalu-
ation of a carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP). Most
often, the small primary tumor is determined to be in the
ipsilateral pharyngeal or lingual tonsil, but particularly with
HPV-related tumors, it can be subtle and readily overlooked.
It is important to evaluate carefully the CT or MR imaging
for asymmetric size of ipsilateral tonsillar tissue and for
heterogeneous tonsillar enhancement. PET/CT is an alter-
nate modality if the lesion is not found on CT or MR images,
and is best performed prior to oropharyngeal biopsies to
avoid a false-positive FDG uptake.

PET/MR imaging is an emerging modality; currently,
there are few sites where these scanners are available for
clinical imaging. MR images of the primary tumor and
nodes and measurements of FDG activity are obtained
simultaneously, resulting in fused PET/MR images. There
presently is little literature on PET/MR imaging for head
and neck tumors and none yet demonstrating increased
accuracy of PET/MR imaging over PET/CT for the staging,
followup, or surveillance of head and neck tumors. There
is reduced ionizing radiation to the patient with PET/MR
imaging as compared to PET/CT.


### Pathological Classification

T categories are the same for clinical and pathological stag-
ing. However, a different pathological N category is pro-
posed for p16+ OPC, based on data from the Washington
University School of Medicine.7-9 High metastatic node
number rather than extracapsular spread, laterality, or nodal
size is the key prognosticator in surgically resected, neck-
dissected p16+ oropharynx cancer.8

One interesting finding in this surgically managed dataset
is that N3 disease behaves unusually well and is equivalent to
N1; therefore, N3 is eliminated from pN categorization. The
favorable outcome for N3 is not apparent in the clinical data-
set. Unlike other head and neck sites, extranodal extension
(ENE) may not have the same prognostic significance, pro-
vided that adjuvant treatments are administered according to
conventional practice. Additionally, NO did not discriminate

between the N1 category but has been left in the neck cate-
gory as NO for data collection and historical reasons.

Primary tumor resection is required to assign pathologi-
cal stage and may be performed using transoral or conven-
tional techniques. Current trends strongly favor transoral
approaches, because they diminish morbidity significantly.
For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include 10
or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical neck
dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph nodes.
Negative pathologic examination of a lesser number of nodes
still mandates a pNO designation.


### Histopathology

Standard nomenclature is unsatisfactory in describing HPV-
mediated p16+ oropharyngeal cancers. The descriptor of
"poorly differentiated," which is based on a high nuclear/
cytoplasmic ratio, is at odds with the known improved prog-
nosis. Therefore, tumor classification as "poorly differenti-
ated oropharyngeal carcinoma" should be avoided. "Basaloid
squamous carcinoma" nosology implies palisading tumor
cells, basement membrane deposition, and cribriform-like
morphology, which also is not the typical phenotype of HPV-
mediated p16+ oropharyngeal cancer. The terminology of
"oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma, nonkeratinzing-type"
is recommended, acknowledging that "nonkeratinizing" is a
low-power descriptor. Observation at higher power confirms
that individual cell keratinization and tumor maturation is
quite common and compatible with the "nonkeratinizing"
descriptor. Grading is not relevant in this context.

The histopathology of HPV-mediated p16+ oropharyn-
geal cancers is characteristic and easily recognizable. The
carcinoma may form nests, islands, or ribbons of tumor cells
with either limited cytoplasm ("basaloid"), moderate amount
of cytoplasm (epithelioid), or individual cell keratinization.
If a ribbon-like pattern is present (transitional pattern), then
tumor maturation and flattened keratinizing cells are seen.
Frank tumor keratinization and keratin pearls usually predict
no association with either HPV-mediated carcinogenesis or
p16 overexpression. In the event that a keratinizing pheno-
type does demonstrate p16 overexpression, it should be
staged in this chapter.

The "inside out" pattern of maturation is another char-
acteristic feature; keratinizing tumor cells are localized
to the periphery of tumor islands, and proliferating tumor
cells are centrally located (Fig. 10.3) This is the converse
of the maturation pattern usually seen in non-HPV-medi-
ated keratinizing squamous carcinoma. Anaplastic tumor
cells with multinucleated or bizarre nuclei can be seen in
HPV-mediated p16+ oropharyngeal cancers, and are a poor
prognosticator.9

Cervical lymph node metastases to level II/III from
an unknown primary are staged in this chapter if p16

<figcaption>Fig. 10.3 In the context of oropharyngeal cancer, these histologies are
predictive of HR-HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and p16 overexpres-
sion.5 (a) These cancers typically are composed of basaloid tumor cells
with minimal cytoplasm. Individual cell keratinization may be
observed at high power; however, overt keratinization is usually not
seen at low-power observation. (b) "Inside out" maturation-The
peripheral rim of the tumor islands is composed of flattened keratiniz- ing tumor cells, while the proliferating more immature cells are cen-
trally located. This is distinct from the usual non-HPV-mediated
keratinizing squamous carcinoma, which reveals central keratiniza-
tion, and proliferating tumor cells at the periphery of tumor islands.
(c) Anaplastic tumor cells, as well as multinucleated tumor cells can be
seen in these carcinomas Fig. 10.4 HR-HPV-mediated
oropharyngeal cancer can form
cystic metastases in cervical
lymph nodes, whereas the
primary carcinoma is usually

document extranodal extension
in this context. This
phenotype, plus p16
overexpression, can be
especially useful for tumors of
unknown primaries. (Top)

overexpression is documented and the histology is consistent
with HPV-mediated carcinogenesis. These metastatic carci-
nomas are invariably cystic and include the other findings
enumerated above (Fig. 10.4). "Normalization" or maturation
of metastatic squamous carcinoma to the point of mimick-
ing a benign cyst is a well-recognized phenomenon; thus the
diagnosis of "malignant transformation of a branchial cleft
cyst" should be rejected. In these cases, additional viral in situ

hybridization studies (HR-HPV, EBER) are recommended.
Ciliated squamous carcinoma cells have been observed
within both cystic primary and metastatic HPV-mediated
cancers, which may also cause diagnostic confusion.10

Finally, there is the potential for confusing nonaggressive
pattern of tumor invasion with noninvasive carcinoma. The
epithelial crypts of Waldeyer's ring are lined by specialized
reticulated epithelium, which is thinner than stratified

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="10 HPV-Mediated (p16+) Oropharyngeal Cancer" -->

squamous epithelium and characterized by abundant intraep-
ithelial lymphocytes and mononuclear cells. The basement
membrane in this region is composed of fine, discontinuous
fibers, thus enabling lymphocyte trafficking.11,12 Because of
the lack of a complete, well-defined basement membrane,
the idea of in situ carcinoma within these crypts is incorrect.
HPV-mediated oropharyngeal carcinoma most often reveals
a nonaggressive pattern of invasion (e.g., transitional pattern,
which is reminiscent of urinary bladder carcinoma). The
smooth, ribbon-like contours of this pattern plus the lack of
desmoplastic response might lead the pathologist toward a
mistaken diagnosis of in situ carcinoma (Fig. 10.4).


### PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping


##### p16 Testing

p16 immunotesting is mandatory to use this staging system
for HPV-associated cancer. HPV by in situ hybridization
(ISH) may be done as an alternative. If a case of oropharyn-
geal cancer does not have p16 or HPV by ISH, then the case
is staged by the p16- negative system (Chapter 11).


### Additional Prognostic Factors Recommended for Clinical Care


#### Overall Health

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of these patients clearly influ-
ences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis
using both tumor- and nontumor-related factors is underway.
Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer
registrars to obtain important information regarding specific
factors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions. AJCC Level of Evidence: III


#### Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of
additional medical illnesses.13 Accurate reporting of all
illnesses in the patients' medical record is essential to
assess these parameters. General performance measures
are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly
recommends that the clinician report performance sta-
tus using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG)/Zubrod or Karnofsky performance measures,
along with standard staging information. An interrelation-
ship between each of the major performance tools exists.

</table>


#### Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking
in pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per
week and number of drinks per day will provide impor-
tant data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to
prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss
of >5% of body weight in the previous 6 months. 14
Depression adversely affects quality of life and survival.
Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depression
should be recorded in the medical record.15 AJCC Level
of Evidence: III


#### Tobacco Use

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard
to apply accurately to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III

Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years,
\> 10 but ≤20 pack-years, or >20 pack-years.


## RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used to
evaluate published statistical prediction models for the pur-
pose of granting endorsement for clinical use.16 Although this
is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medicine,
this work was published only very recently. Therefore, the
existing models that have been published or may be in clini-
cal use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by the

tistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.

## INTRODUCTION

The epidemic of HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancer and its
significantly different behavior and natural history has resulted
in the need to develop two different staging systems for oro-
pharynx cancer: one for HPV-positive and another for HPV-
negative cancers.45 Historically, the pharynx was covered in a
single chapter, but in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 8th
Edition (8th Edition), the recognition of the unique nature of
the two virally mediated diseases of the nasopharynx and
oropharynx have resulted in dividing one chapter into three.
This chapter deals with p16- oropharyngeal cancers and all
mucosally based hypopharyngeal cancers. The staging of
these two sites will be similar to the AJCC Cancer Staging
Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition), with the exception of the N
category and the removal of TO. TO will be used only when a
node is p16+, and therefore staged in the HPV-associated oro-
pharynx chapter, EBV-associated and staged in the nasophar-
ynx chapter, or staged in the cervical node chapter. ENE has
such a profound effect on outcome that it has been incorpo-
rated into the determination of N.6

The effect of ENE on prognosis of head and neck cancers
not caused by HPV is profound. Accounting for this impor-
tant prognostic feature was considered critical in revising
staging. ENE will increase the pathological nodal category by
1 (as described in the section "Definitions of AJCC TNM").

Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse prognostic
factor is based on histopathological characterization of ENE,
especially the distinction between microscopic and macro-
scopic ENE.3,7,8 Therefore, only unquestionable ENE is to be
used for clinical staging. As per the "uncertain rule" of the
AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging,
which mandates that the lower category should always be

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="11 Oropharynx (p16-) and Hypopharynx" -->
<!-- PageNumber="125" -->

assigned in ambiguous cases, a case should be categorized as
ENE(-) unless there is unquestionable ENE. For clinical ENE,
the known inability of current imaging modalities to define
ENE accurately mandated that stringent criteria are met prior to
assigning a clinical diagnosis of ENE.9 However, unambiguous
evidence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion
of skin; infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adjacent
structures; or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk,
or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) supported by
strong radiographic evidence permit classification of disease as
ENE(+). Pathological ENE also will be clearly defined below.
Again, if there is doubt or uncertainty of the presence of ENE,
the case should be categorized as ENE(-).

TNM staging of cancers of the oropharynx not associated
with HPV and cancers of the hypopharynx is critical to under-
standing their natural history. The stage groupings provide
stratification for prognosis that is valuable to the clinician and
the individual patient. Taking the p16+, HPV-mediated can-
cers out of this staging increases its utility and accuracy.


## ANATOMY


### Primary Site(s)

Cancers arise in the mucosa of the oropharynx and hypo-
pharynx (Fig.11.1). They invade into neighboring structures
as they advance.


### Oropharynx

The oropharynx is the portion of the continuity of the pharynx
extending from the plane of the superior surface of the soft
palate to the superior surface of the hyoid bone (or vallecula).
It includes the base of the tongue, the inferior (anterior) sur-

face of the soft palate and the uvula, the anterior and posterior
tonsillar pillars, the glossotonsillar sulci, the pharyngeal ton-
sils, and the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls.


### Hypopharynx

The hypopharynx is that portion of the pharynx extending
from the plane of the superior border of the hyoid bone (or
vallecula) to the plane corresponding to the lower border of
the cricoid cartilage. It includes the pyriform sinuses (right
and left), the lateral and posterior hypopharyngeal walls, and
the postcricoid region. The postcricoid area extends from the
level of the arytenoid cartilages and connecting folds to the
plane of the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage. It con-
nects the two pyriform sinuses, thus forming the anterior
wall of the hypopharynx. The pyriform sinus extends from
the pharyngoepiglottic fold to the upper end of the esopha-
gus at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage and is bounded
laterally by the lateral pharyngeal wall and medially by the
lateral surface of the aryepiglottic fold and the arytenoid and
cricoid cartilages. The posterior pharyngeal wall extends
from the level of the superior surface of the hyoid bone (or
vallecula) to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage and
from the apex of one pyriform sinus to the other.


### Regional Lymph Nodes

The risk of regional nodal spread from cancers of the pharynx
is high. Oropharyngeal cancers usually involve upper and mid-
jugular lymph nodes and (less commonly) submental/subman-
dibular nodes. Base of tongue cancers often manifest bilateral
lymphatic drainage. Hypopharyngeal cancers spread to adja-
cent parapharyngeal, paratracheal, and mid- and lower jugular
nodes. Bilateral lymphatic drainage is common. In clinical

evaluation, the maximum size of the nodal mass should be
measured. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes.
Superior mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional
lymph nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to
describe the N category, regional lymph nodes should also be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.


### Metastatic Sites

The lungs are the most common site of distant metastases;
skeletal or hepatic metastases occur less often. Mediastinal
lymph node metastases are considered distant metastases,
except level VII lymph nodes.


## RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


### Clinical Classification

Clinical staging is essential for squamous cell carcinomas of
the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Assessment is based pri-
marily on inspection and on indirect and direct endoscopy.
Palpation of sites (when feasible) and of neck nodes is essen-
tial. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is required.
Complete endoscopy, usually under general anesthesia, is
performed after completion of other staging studies, to assess
the surface extent of the tumor accurately and to assess deep
involvement by palpation for muscle invasion and to facili-
tate biopsy. A careful search for other primary tumors of the
upper aerodigestive tract may be indicated because of the
potential of multiple independent primary tumors occurring
simultaneously.

In clinical evaluation, the maximum size of any nodal
mass should be measured. There are three categories of
clinically involved nodes for the oropharynx: N1, N2, and
N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior
mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph
nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to describe
the N category, regional lymph nodes should also be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
Provide a description or map of the regional lymph nodes
and node groups that the cancer affects. Unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE extension (i.e., defined as invasion of
skin, infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent struc-
tures on clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus,
sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunc-
tion) is a sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clini-
cal ENE (ENE.) and qualifies as ENE(+) for definition of cN.

Evidence of cranial nerve dysfunction should be sought
(testing sensation and motion to command) and skin should
be examined for evidence of invasion by underlying nodes.
Palpable neck nodes should be considered in terms of their
location (level in the neck), size, number, character (smooth

or irregular), attachment to other nodes, and mobility. Nodes
that do not move in all directions may be invading nearby
structures. Invasion of the sternomastoid muscle and or cra-
nial nerves is associated with lateral motion but restricted
ability to move the node along the cranial-caudal axis.
Inability to move the node at all (without moving the head) is
worrisome for ENE, though the suspicion should be tem-
pered for smaller nodes with limited mobility in level
II. Assignment of ENE should be based almost entirely upon
the physical examination, rather than upon imaging studies;
gross ENE is required to raise the stage beyond the assign-
ment based upon node size and number and this may be
overestimated with current imaging modalities.

The known lack of ability for radiographic imaging accu-
rately to define ENE suggests the need for stringent criteria
prior to assigning ENE on a clinical basis. Imaging studies
showing amorphous spiculated margins of involved nodes or
involvement of internodal fat resulting in loss of normal oval-
to-round nodal shape suggest extranodal spread of tumor but
are not sufficient without corresponding evidence on physical
examination. Pathological examination is necessary for doc-
umentation of such disease extent. No imaging study (as yet)
can identify microscopic foci in regional nodes or distinguish
between small reactive nodes and small malignant nodes
(unless central radiographic inhomogeneity is present).


### Imaging

Both contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allow excellent evaluation
of the primary oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal tumor and
of nodal drainage sites. Positron emission tomography (PET)/
CT is being used with greater frequency for staging, treat-
ment evaluation, and surveillance. It may offer an advantage
in detection of an otherwise clinically occult primary tumor.

Imaging staging of a known oropharyngeal or hypopha-
ryngeal tumor requires a systematic review of the primary
tumor, nodal drainage sites and imaged potential sites of
spread. For this purpose, structured reporting may offer
advantages to the radiologist for ensuring that critical infor-
mation is not omitted.


### Primary Tumor

The subsite of the oropharynx should be clarified (palatine/
lingual tonsil, tonsillar pillar, posterior pharyngeal wall, soft
palate). The size of the primary tumor should be measured
along its longest diameter to determine whether this is T1 (≤
2cm), T2 (>2 cm and ≤4cm) or T3 (>4cm). It may be diffi-
cult to be certain by imaging whether a base of tongue tumor
is extending along the mucosal surface of the lingual aspect of
the epiglottis (also T3), or whether the exophytic tumor is
abutting against this surface. In these situations, clarification
by direct clinical observation is essential. T4 disease is deter-
mined by invasion anteriorly to the extrinsic muscles of the
tongue in the floor of the mouth or from the soft palate anteri-

orly to the hard palate, laterally into the pterygoid muscles or
mandible, inferiorly to the larynx or superiorly to the skull
base or beyond. Skull base involvement also necessitates care-
ful evaluation for perineural and intracranial spread of tumor.
Cross-sectional imaging of hypopharyngeal carcinoma is rec-
ommended to define the extent of the primary tumor, particu-
larly its deep extent in relationship to adjacent structures (i.e.,
larynx, cricoid and thyroid cartilage, esophageal muscle, cer-
vical vertebrae, and carotid sheath). CT is preferred currently
because it entails less motion artifact than MR imaging.

CT and MR imaging afford some view of the lungs for
metastases, albeit with only a small volume of the lungs
being imaged and with low sensitivity for MR imaging. A
complete staging report includes evaluation of the lung api-
ces for potential metastases and of the bones of the skull and
cervical spine for metastatic disease. PET/CT allows more
accurate and complete evaluation for distant metastatic dis-
ease, which is most often to the lung, bone, and liver.

There are specific pitfalls in imaging that relate to the imag-
ing modality being used or to strict interpretation of the defini-
tions of tumor involvement. Detection of metastatic involvement
of nodes with either CT or MR imaging requires careful evalu-
ation of multiple morphological features: size, shape, density
(intensity on MR imaging), necrosis, and extranodal spread of
tumor. It is important to review all criteria and not merely the
size of a lymph node. This should also be performed in con-
junction with knowledge of the expected drainage pattern of
the tumor. As stated previously, oropharyngeal tumors most
often drain to the upper and mid jugular nodes (levels 2 and 3
respectively), and bilateral drainage is frequent. These nodal
sites should be carefully scrutinized for abnormal shape, size,
contour, and texture. The retropharyngeal nodes (RPN) should
also be evaluated, particularly when a posterior pharyngeal
wall tumor is present. Keep in mind that unless cystic or
necrotic, RPN frequently appear isodense to the adjacent pre-
vertebral muscles on CT making them readily overlooked.
Imaging studies showing amorphous spiculated margins of
involved nodes or involvement of internodal fat resulting in
loss of normal oval-to-round nodal shape suggest extranodal
spread of tumor but are not sufficient without corresponding
evidence on physical examination to classify as ENE(+).

PET/CT for head and neck malignancies are best per-
formed with contrast-enhanced CT portions of the examina-
tion and preferably with dedicated smaller field of view
(FOV) neck images. When iodinated contrast is not employed
for PET/CT, it is also difficult to evaluate for specific sites of
disease involvement that might upstage a tumor. For exam-
ple, determining the presence of medial or lateral pterygoid
muscle involvement (both T4) by a tonsillar carcinoma is
difficult when relying on non-contrast large FOV CT for cor-
relation with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET uptake.

Some subtleties of tumor involvement for staging also
require clarification. The palatoglossus muscle forms the
muscle bulk of the anterior tonsillar pillar and may be

invaded with even a relatively small tonsillar or tonsillar pil-
lar tumor. Although palatoglossus is defined as an extrinsic
muscle of the tongue, involvement of this muscle within the
oropharynx does not denote a significantly poorer prognosis
for the patient and does not change the T category.


### Pathological Classification

Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional nodal
dissections, followed by pathological examination of the
resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation for
pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected after
radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and consid-
ered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived from
the actual measurement of the unfixed tumor in the surgical
specimen. It should be noted, however, that up to 30%
shrinkage of soft tissues may occur in the resected specimen
after formalin fixation. Pathological staging represents addi-
tional and important information and should be included as
such in staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as
the primary staging scheme.

For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include
10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical
neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph
nodes. Negative pathological examination of a smaller num-
ber of nodes still mandates a pNO designation.


### Definition of ENE and Description of its extent

All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined for
the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of ENE
has also varied in the literature over the course of time. The
College of American Pathologists defines ENE as extension of
metastatic tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connec-
tive tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.

ENE detected on histopathologic examination is designated
as ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be required
for current pN definition, but data collection is recommended
to allow standardization of data collection and future
analysis.


## PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping


#### p16 Immunotesting

Testing for p16 is mandatory for all oropharyngeal squamous
carcinomas but not for hypopharyngeal cancers. If p16 test-
ing is not performed, that case is staged according to this
system for p16- cancers. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

## Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care


### Extranodal Extension

ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE (i.e., defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk or
phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a sufficiently
high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE(+). AJCC
Level of Evidence: III


### Overall Health

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of these patients clearly
influences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess
prognosis using both tumor and nontumor-related factors
is underway. Chart abstraction will continue to be per-
formed by cancer registrars to obtain important informa-
tion regarding specific factors related to prognosis. These
data will then be used to further hone the predictive power
of the staging system in future revisions. AJCC Level of
Evidence: II


### Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.1º Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patients' medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful
in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the
clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures along with standard staging informa-
tion. An interrelationship between each of the major perfor-
mance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II

</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Death (Karnofsky 0)</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse negatively
influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in pack-
years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week and
number of drinks per day will provide import
ant data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to
prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss
of>5% of body weight in the previous 6 months.11 Depression
adversely affects quality of life and survival. Notation of a
previous or current diagnosis of depression should be
recorded in the medical record.12 AJCC Level of Evidence: III


### Tobacco Use

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard to
apply accurately to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III

Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack years.


## RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.13 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medi-
cine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore,
the existing models that have been published or may be in
clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by
the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the
statistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.

## HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE

The predominant cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The
staging guidelines are applicable to all forms of carci-
noma, including those arising from minor salivary glands.
Other nonepithelial tumors such as those of lymphoid tis-
sue, soft tissue, bone, and cartilage (i.e., lymphoma and
sarcoma) are not included. Histologic confirmation of
diagnosis is required. Histopathologic grading of squa-
mous carcinoma is recommended. The grade is subjective
and uses a descriptive as well as numerical form (i.e., well
differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly dif-
ferentiated), depending on the degree of closeness to or
deviation from squamous epithelium in mucosal sites.
Also recommended where feasible is a quantitative evalu-
ation of depth of invasion of the primary tumor and the
presence or absence of vascular invasion and perineural
invasion. Although the grade of tumor does not enter into
the staging of the tumor, it should be recorded. The patho-
logical description of any lymphadenectomy specimen
should describe the size, number, and position of the
involved node(s) and the presence or absence of ENE.

#### INTRODUCTION

Malignancies that arise in the epithelial lining of the parana-
sal sinuses and nasal cavity, with the exception of lymphoma
and sarcoma, are staged according to this system. Many his-
tologic subtypes exist and also are a factor in determining
prognosis.4 T category is identical to the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 7th
Edition (7th Edition). As in other head and neck sites, the N
category has been expanded to incorporate extranodal exten-
sion (ENE).5

The role of ENE in prognosis of head and neck cancers
is profound. Accounting for this important prognostic fea-
ture was considered critical in revising staging. Most of the
data supporting ENE as an adverse prognostic factor are
based on histopathological characterization of ENE, espe-
cially the distinction between microscopic and macro-
scopic or gross ENE.3,6,7 As per the "uncertain rule" of the
AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)
staging, which mandates that the lower category should
always be assigned in ambiguous cases, a case should be
categorized as ENE(-) unless there is unquestionable
ENE. For clinical ENE, the known inability of current
imaging modalities to define ENE accurately mandated
that stringent criteria be met prior to assigning a clinical
diagnosis of ENE.8 However, unambiguous evidence of
gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion of skin,
infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adjacent
structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic
trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) sup-
ported by strong radiographic evidence permit classifica-
tion of disease as ENE(+). Pathological ENE also will be
clearly defined in this chapter. Again, if there is doubt or
uncertainty of the presence of ENE, the case should be cat-
egorized as ENE(-).

Cancer of the maxillary sinus is the most common of the
sinonasal malignancies. Ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity
cancers are equal in frequency, but considerably less com-
mon than maxillary sinus cancers. Tumors of the sphenoid
and frontal sinuses are rare.

#### ANATOMY


##### Primary Site(s)

The location and the extent of the mucosal lesion within the
maxillary sinus have prognostic significance. Historically, a
plane connecting the medial canthus of the eye to the angle
of the mandible, represented by Ohngren's line, is used to
divide the maxillary sinus into an anteroinferior portion
(infrastructure), which is associated with a good prognosis,
and a posterosuperior portion (suprastructure), which has a
poor prognosis (Fig. 12.1). The poorer outcome associated
with suprastructure cancers reflects early invasion by these
tumors to critical structures, including the orbit, skull base,
pterygoid plates, and infratemporal fossa.

For the purpose of staging, the nasoethmoidal complex is
divided into two sites: nasal cavity and ethmoid sinuses. The
ethmoids are further subdivided into two subsites: left and
right, separated by the nasal septum (perpendicular plate of
ethmoid). The nasal cavity is divided into four subsites: the

septum, floor, lateral wall, and the edge of naris to mucocu-
taneous junction.

#### Regional Lymph Nodes

Regional lymph node spread from cancer of nasal cavity and
paranasal sinuses is relatively uncommon. Involvement of
buccinator, prevascular facial, submandibular, upper jugular,
and (occasionally) retropharyngeal nodes may occur with

advanced maxillary sinus cancer, particularly those extend-
ing beyond the sinus walls to involve adjacent structures,
including soft tissues of the cheek, upper alveolus, palate,
and buccal mucosa or overlying skin. Ethmoid sinus cancers
are less prone to regional lymphatic spread. When only one
side of the neck is involved, it should be considered ipsilat-
eral. Bilateral spread may occur with advanced primary can-
cer, particularly with spread of the primary beyond the
midline.


#### Metastatic Sites

Distant spread usually occurs to lungs, but occasionally there
is spread to bone.


#### RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


##### Clinical Classification

The assessment of primary maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, and
ethmoid tumors is based on inspection and palpation, includ-
ing examination of the orbits, nasal and oral cavities, and
nasopharynx, and neurologic evaluation of the cranial
nerves. Nasal endoscopy with rigid or fiberoptic flexible
instruments is recommended for inspection and biopsy.

Neck nodes are assessed by palpation. In clinical evalu-
ation, the maximum size of any nodal mass should be
measured. Biopsy, when indicated, is done with a fine nee-
dle and not open approach and is included in clinical clas-
sification if done. The three categories of clinically involved
nodes for the nasal cavity and paranasal sinus are N1, N2,
and N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes.
Superior mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional
lymph nodes (level VII). In addition to the components to
describe the N category, regional lymph nodes should also
be described according to the level of the neck that is
involved. Provide a description or map of the regional
lymph nodes and node groups that the cancer affects.
Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE (i.e., defined as inva-
sion of skin, infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent
structures on clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial
plexus, sympathetic trunk or phrenic nerve invasion with
dysfunction) is a sufficiently high threshold to classify
these as clinical ENE(+). Examinations for distant metasta-
ses include appropriate imaging, blood chemistries, blood
count, and other routine studies as indicated. Biopsy is typi-
cally needed to confirm metastasis, although a risk-to-ben-
efit ratio is always weighed and is included in clinical stage
as pM1 if done.

Imaging studies showing amorphous spiculated margins
of involved nodes or involvement of internodal fat result-

ing in loss of normal oval-to-round nodal shape strongly
suggest extracapsular (extranodal) tumor spread. No imag-
ing study (as yet) can identify microscopic foci in regional
nodes or distinguish between small reactive nodes and
small malignant nodes without central radiographic
inhomogeneity.


##### Imaging

Imaging is beneficial for lesions that cannot be fully assessed
on clinical examination, locally advanced disease, or symp-
tomatic patients. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging are complementary imaging stud-
ies for staging patients with cancers involving the nasal cav-
ity and/or the paranasal sinuses. There is no indication for
plain films or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT for
staging of the primary site. PET-CT may be helpful for
assessing nodal metastases; however, lymph node staging is
discussed in Chapter 6.

CT is superior to MR imaging for identifying bone ero-
sion of thin walls and septa of the paranasal sinuses. CT is
superior to MR imaging for identifying involvement of the
hard palate. Either CT or MR imaging may be performed for
tumor extending outside of the nose and/or paranasal sinuses
to involve the adjacent structures, including the orbital apex
(T4b). MR imaging, especially with T2-weighted images, is
helpful for tumor mapping and for distinguishing between
tumor extension and obstructed secretions. Tumors may
obstruct the frontal recess or sphenoethmoidal recess, which
may result in obstruction of the frontal or sphenoid sinus,
respectively. Differential between tumor extension and pro-
teinaceous obstructed secretions is best performed with MR
imaging, which will help accurately identify T4a tumors.
Both CT and MR imaging may be used to evaluate for poste-
rior spread to the pterygopalantine fossa. However, MR
imaging is superior to CT for evaluating for retrograde peri-
neural spread along V2 through foramen rotundum or V3.
CT is superior to MR imaging for early cortical involvement,
but MR imaging is superior to CT for bone marrow invasion.
MR imaging also is superior to CT for identifying dural
involvement or other types of intracranial extension (T4b).


##### Pathological Classification

Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional nodal
dissections, followed by pathological examination of the
resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation for
pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected after
radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and consid-
ered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived from
the invasion of bone, orbit, dura, and presence of disease in
multiple subsites. Pathological staging represents additional
and important information and should be included as such in

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="141" -->
<!-- PageHeader="12 Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses" -->

staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as the pri-
mary staging scheme.

For pN, a selective neck dissection will ordinarily include
10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or modified radical
neck dissection will ordinarily include 15 or more lymph
nodes. Negative pathological examination of a smaller num-
ber of nodes still mandates a pNO designation.


##### Definition of ENE and Description of Its Extent

All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined
for the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of
ENE has varied in the literature over the course of time. The
American College of Pathologists defines ENE as extension of
metastatic tumor, present within the confines of the lymph
node, through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding
connective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.

ENE detected on histopathologic examination is desig-
nated as ENEmi (microscopic ENE ≤2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be
required for current pN definition, but data collection is rec-
ommended to allow standardization of data collection and
future analysis.


#### PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


##### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping

Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage grouping.


##### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care


###### Extranodal Extension (ENE)

ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
beyond the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE extension (i.e., defined as invasion of skin,
infiltration of musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on
clinical examination, cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) is a
sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical
ENE(+). AJCC Level of Evidence: III


###### Overall Health

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of the patient clearly influences
outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using

both tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart
abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer regis-
trars to obtain important information regarding specific fac-
tors related to prognosis. These data will then be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions.


###### Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of addi-
tional medical illnesses.9 Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patient's medical record is essential to the assessment
of these parameters. General performance measures are
helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recom-
mends the clinician report performance status using the
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or
Karnofsky performance measures, along with standard stag-
ing information. An interrelationship between each of the
major performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: III

</table>


###### Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking
in pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per
week and number of drinks per day will provide impor-
tant data for future analysis. Nutrition is important to
prognosis and will be indirectly measured by weight loss
of>5% of body weight in the previous 6 months.10
Depression adversely impacts quality of life and survival.
Notation of a previous or current diagnosis of depression
should be recorded in the medical record.11 AJCC Level
of Evidence: III

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. However, exactly how this could be codified in
the staging system is less clear. At this time, smoking is
known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but is hard
to accurately apply to the staging system.

<!-- PageNumber="12" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="142" -->
<!-- PageHeader="American Joint Committee on Cancer . 2017" -->

Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10 pack-years, >
10 but ≤ 20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.


#### RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used
to evaluate published statistical prediction models for the
purpose of granting endorsement for clinical use.12 Although
this is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medi-
cine, this work was published only very recently. Therefore,
the existing models that have been published or may be in
clinical use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site
by the Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future,
the statistical prediction models for this cancer site will be
evaluated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be
endorsed.

## HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE

The predominant cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The
staging guidelines are applicable to all forms of carcinoma,
including those arising from minor salivary glands. Other
nonepithelial tumors such as those of lymphoid tissue, soft
tissue, bone, and cartilage (i.e., lymphoma and sarcoma) are
not included. Histologic confirmation of diagnosis is
required. Histopathologic grading of squamous carcinoma is
recommended. The grade is subjective and uses a descrip-
tive, as well as numerical, form (i.e., well differentiated,
moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated),
depending on the degree of closeness to or deviation from
squamous epithelium in mucosal sites. Also recommended
where feasible is a quantitative evaluation of depth of inva-
sion of the primary tumor and the presence or absence of
vascular invasion and perineural invasion. Although the
grade of tumor does not enter into the staging of the tumor, it
should be recorded. The pathological description of any
lymphadenectomy specimen should describe the size, num-
ber, and position of the involved node(s) and the presence or
absence of ENE.

# INTRODUCTION

Cancers of the larynx are staged using the TNM system. The
T category is unchanged from the American Joint Committee
on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition. N
category, however, now includes extranodal extension (ENE)
in categorizing metastatic cancer to neck nodes. The effect of
ENE in prognosis on head and neck cancers not caused by
human papilloma virus (HPV) is profound.4 Including this
important prognostic feature was considered critical in revis-
ing staging. Most of the data supporting ENE as an adverse
prognostic factor are based on histopathological character-
ization of ENE, especially the distinction between micro-
scopic and macroscopic (or gross) ENE.3,5,6 Therefore, only
unquestionable ENE is used for clinical staging. For clinical
ENE, the known inability of current imaging modalities to
define ENE accurately mandated stringent criteria for assign-
ing a clinical diagnosis of ENE. However, unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE on clinical examination (e.g., invasion
of skin, infiltration of musculature/dense tethering to adja-
cent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction)
supported by strong radiographic evidence permits classifi-
cation of disease as N3b. Pathological ENE also will be
clearly defined in this chapter. As per the "uncertain rule" of
the AJCC/UICC staging, which mandates that the lower cat-
egory always be assigned in ambiguous cases, a case should
be categorized as ENE(-) unless there is unquestionable
ENE.

A staging system should address and respond to new
information that influences patient outcome. An appropriate
balance between complexity and compliance (ease-of-use) is
necessary for worldwide adoption. The TNM system has
strongly predicted prognosis over the years and is adopted
worldwide. The introduction of the new parameter of ENE
better fits the prognostic modeling from large datasets. It
must be balanced, however, by the ability to derive accurate
information from clinicians caring for patients with head and

neck cancer in many different environments. Thorough
descriptions of ENE are included in the Definition of ENE
and Description of its Extent section of this chapter.
Effectively, ENE will increase the nodal category by 1 (dem-
onstrated in this chapter).


# ANATOMY


## Primary Site(s)

The following anatomic definition of the larynx allows clas-
sification of carcinomas arising in the encompassed mucous
membranes but excludes cancers arising on the lateral or
posterior pharyngeal wall, pyriform fossa, postcricoid area,
or base of tongue.

The anterior limit of the larynx is composed of the ante-
rior or lingual surface of the suprahyoid epiglottis, the thyro-
hyoid membrane, the anterior commissure, and the anterior
wall of the subglottic region, which is composed of the thy-
roid cartilage, the cricothyroid membrane, and the anterior
arch of the cricoid cartilage.

The posterior and lateral limits include the laryngeal
aspect of the aryepiglottic folds, the arytenoid region, the
interarytenoid space, and the posterior surface of the sub-
glottic space, represented by the mucous membrane covering
the surface of the cricoid cartilage.

The superolateral limits are composed of the tip and the
lateral borders of the epiglottis. The inferior limits are made
up of the plane passing through the inferior edge of the cri-
coid cartilage.

For purposes of this clinical stage classification, the lar-
ynx is divided into three regions: supraglottis, glottis, and
subglottis (Fig. 13.1). The supraglottis is composed of the

epiglottis (both its lingual and laryngeal aspects), aryepi-
glottic folds (laryngeal aspect), arytenoids, and ventricular
bands (false cords) (Fig. 13.2). The epiglottis is divided for
staging purposes into suprahyoid and infrahyoid portions
by a plane at the level of the hyoid bone. The inferior
boundary of the supraglottis is a horizontal plane passing
through the lateral margin of the ventricle at its junction
with the superior surface of the vocal cord. The glottis is
composed of the superior and inferior surfaces of the true
vocal cords, including the anterior and posterior commis-
sures (Fig. 13.2). It occupies a horizontal plane 1 cm in
thickness, extending inferiorly from the lateral margin of
the ventricle. The subglottis is the region extending from
the lower boundary of the glottis to the lower margin of the
cricoid cartilage.

The division of the larynx is summarized as follows:

## Regional Lymph Nodes

The risk of regional metastasis generally is related to the T
category. The incidence and distribution of cervical nodal
metastases from cancer of the larynx vary with the site of ori-
gin and the T category of the primary tumor. The true vocal
cords are nearly devoid of lymphatics, and tumors limited to

the glottis alone rarely spread to regional nodes. By contrast,
the supraglottis has a rich and bilaterally interconnected lym-
phatic network, so primary supraglottic cancers commonly are
accompanied by regional lymph node spread. Advanced glot-
tic tumors may spread directly to adjacent soft tissues, to pre-
laryngeal, pretracheal, paralaryngeal, and paratracheal nodes,
as well as to upper, mid, and lower jugular nodes. Supraglottic
tumors commonly spread to upper and mid jugular nodes,
considerably less commonly to submental or submandibular
nodes, and occasionally to retropharyngeal nodes. The rare
subglottic primary tumors spread first to adjacent soft tissues
and prelaryngeal, pretracheal, paralaryngeal, and paratracheal
nodes, then to mid and lower jugular nodes. Contralateral lym-
phatic spread is common. Any previous manipulation to the
neck, through surgery or radiation, may alter normal lym-
phatic drainage patterns, resulting in unusual distribution of
regional spread of disease to the cervical lymph nodes.


## Metastatic Sites

Distant spread is common only for patients who have bulky
regional lymphadenopathy. When distant metastases occur,
spread to the lungs is most common; skeletal or hepatic
metastases occur less often. Mediastinal lymph node metas-
tases are considered distant metastases, except Level VII
lymph nodes (in the anterior superior mediastinum, cephalad
to the innominate artery).


# RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


## Clinical Classification

Clinical staging is essential for squamous cell carcinomas
of the larynx. Assessment is primarily based on inspec-
tion of the larynx via indirect and direct endoscopy.

Palpation of sites (when feasible) and of neck nodes is
essential. Neurologic evaluation of all cranial nerves is
required. Complete endoscopy, usually under general
anesthesia, is performed after completion of other staging
studies, to assess the surface extent of the tumor accu-
rately, assess for vocal cord mobility, and facilitate biopsy.
A careful search for other primary tumors of the upper
aerodigestive tract may be indicated because of the poten-
tial of multiple independent primary tumors occurring
simultaneously.

Primary site clinical staging for supraglottic carcinoma is
based on involvement of various subsites of the supraglottic
larynx adjacent regions and vocal cord mobility. Imaging
may be helpful to identify occult submucosal transglottic
extension. Imaging criteria that define T3 lesions are exten-
sion into the preepiglottic space (paralaryngeal fat) or tumors
that erode the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage. Tumors
that erode the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage are defined
as T4a tumors.

In clinical evaluation of the neck, the maximum size of
any nodal mass should be measured. There are three catego-
ries of clinically involved nodes for the larynx: N1, N2, and
N3. Midline nodes are considered ipsilateral nodes. Superior
mediastinal lymph nodes are considered regional lymph
nodes (Level VII). In addition to the components to describe
the N category, regional lymph nodes also should be
described according to the level of the neck that is involved.
Provide a description or map of the regional lymph nodes
and node groups that the cancer affects. Unambiguous evi-
dence of gross ENE (i.e., invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, or invasion of cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve with dysfunction) is a
sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE
(ENE.) and qualifies as ENE(+) for definition of cN.

The known lack of ability for radiographic imaging to
define ENE accurately suggests the need for stringent crite-
ria prior to assigning ENE on a clinical basis. Imaging stud-
ies showing amorphous spiculated margins of involved
nodes or involvement of internodal fat resulting in loss of
normal oval-to-round nodal shape suggest extranodal spread
of tumor but are not sufficient without corresponding evi-
dence on physical examination. Pathological examination is
necessary for documentation of such disease extent. No
imaging study (as yet) can identify microscopic foci in
regional nodes or distinguish between small reactive nodes
and small malignant nodes (unless central radiographic
inhomogeneity is present).


## Imaging

Both contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allow excellent evalua-
tion of the primary tumor and of nodal drainage sites.7

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="153" -->
<!-- PageHeader="13 Larynx" -->

Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is being used with
greater frequency for staging, treatment evaluation, and sur-
veillance. It may offer an advantage in detection of an other-
wise clinically occult primary tumor.

For T1 and T2 tumors of the glottic larynx, cross-sec-
tional imaging may be used to ensure that the clinical diag-
nosis of early stage lesions is correct. Imaging may be used
as an important adjunct to identify the presence of submu-
cosal extension, especially at the anterior commissure
where lesions may spread anteriorly along Broyle's liga-
ment to involve the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage.
Imaging also may identify glottic carcinomas that have
occult transglottic or subglottic spread. The normal para-
glottic space often is difficult to routinely detect at the level
of the true vocal cord due to the close apposition of the
lateral thyroarytenoid muscle to the inner cortex of the thy-
roid cartilage. Tumor erosion limited to the inner cortex of
the thyroid cartilage indicates a T3 lesion, whereas carci-
nomas that erode the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage
define a T4a tumor. Stage T4 (a and b) is difficult to iden-
tify based on clinical examination alone, because the
majority of the criteria cannot be assessed by endoscopy
and palpation.


## Pathological Classification

Pathological staging requires the use of all information
obtained in clinical staging and in histologic study of the sur-
gically resected specimen. The surgeon's evaluation of gross
unresected residual tumor also must be included.

Complete resection of the primary site and/or regional
nodal dissections, followed by pathological examination of
the resected specimen(s), allows the use of this designation
for pT and/or pN, respectively. Specimens that are resected
after radiation or chemotherapy need to be identified and
considered in context, and use yp instead of p. pT is derived
from the actual measurement of the unfixed tumor in the sur-
gical specimen. It should be noted, however, that up to 30 %
shrinkage of soft tissues may occur in resected specimen
after formalin fixation. Pathological staging represents addi-
tional and important information and should be included as
such in staging, but it does not supplant clinical staging as
the primary staging scheme.

Histopathologic grading of squamous carcinoma is rec-
ommended. The grade is subjective and uses a descriptive, as
well as a numerical, form (i.e., well differentiated, moder-
ately differentiated, and poorly differentiated), depending on
the degree of closeness to or deviation from squamous epi-
thelium in mucosal sites. Also recommended, where feasi-
ble, is a quantitative evaluation of depth of invasion of the
primary tumor and the presence or absence of vascular inva-
sion and perineural invasion. Although the grade of tumor

does not enter into the staging of the tumor, it should be
recorded.

The pathological description of any lymphadenectomy
specimen should describe the size, number, and location/
level of the involved node(s) and the presence or absence
of ENE. For pN, a selective neck dissection ordinarily
will include 10 or more lymph nodes, and a radical or
modified radical neck dissection ordinarily will include
15 or more lymph nodes. Negative pathological examina-
tion of a smaller number of nodes still mandates a pNO
designation.


## Definition of ENE and Description of its Extent

All surgically resected metastatic nodes should be examined
for the presence and extent of ENE. The precise definition of
ENE also has varied in the literature over time. The American
College of Pathologists defines ENE as extension of meta-
static tumor, present within the confines of the lymph node,
through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding con-
nective tissue, with or without associated stromal reaction.
Pathological examination is necessary for documentation of
such disease extent.

ENE detected on histopathologic examination is desig-
nated as ENEmi (microscopic ENE≤2mm) or ENEma (major
ENE>2mm). Both ENEmi and ENEma qualify as ENE(+) for
definition of pN. These descriptors of ENE will not be
required for current pN definition, but data collection is rec-
ommended to allow standardization of data collection and
future analysis.


# PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


## Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping

Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories,
no additional prognostic factors are required for stage
grouping.


## Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined
previously, the overall health of these patients clearly influ-
ences outcome. An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis
using both tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway.
Chart abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer
registrars to obtain important information regarding specific
factors related to prognosis. These data then will be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions.

## Extranodal Extension

ENE is defined as extension of metastatic tumor, present
within the confines of the lymph node, through the lymph
node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or
without associated stromal reaction. Unambiguous evidence
of gross ENE (i.e., defined as invasion of skin, infiltration of
musculature/fixation to adjacent structures on clinical exam-
ination, or invasion of cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympa-
thetic trunk, or phrenic nerve with dysfunction) is a
sufficiently high threshold to classify these as clinical ENE+.
AJCC Level of Evidence: III


## Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of
additional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all ill-
nesses in the patient's medical record is essential to
assessment of these parameters. General performance
measures are helpful in predicting survival. The AJCC
strongly recommends the clinician report performance
status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance measures,
along with standard staging information. An interrelation-
ship between each of the major performance tools exists.
AJCC Level of Evidence: II8

<tr>

</table>


## Lifestyle factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be measured indirectly by weight loss of>5% of body
weight in the previous 6 months.9 Depression adversely
impacts quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.1º AJCC Level of Evidence: III


## Tobacco Use

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. Exactly how this could be codified in the staging
system, however, is less clear. At this time, smoking is known
to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is difficult to
accurately apply it to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III

Smoking history should be collected as an important ele-
ment of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic
Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard
should classify smoking history as never, ≤10 pack-years,
\>10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.


# RISK ASSESSMENT MODELS

The AJCC recently established guidelines that will be used to
evaluate published statistical prediction models for the pur-
pose of granting endorsement for clinical use.11 Although this
is a monumental step toward the goal of precision medicine,
this work was published only very recently. Therefore, the
existing models that have been published or may be in clini-
cal use have not yet been evaluated for this cancer site by the
Precision Medicine Core of the AJCC. In the future, the sta-
tistical prediction models for this cancer site will be evalu-
ated, and those that meet all AJCC criteria will be endorsed.

# HISTOPATHOLOGIC TYPE

The predominant cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The
staging guidelines are applicable to all forms of epithelial
carcinoma, including those arising from minor salivary
glands. Other nonepithelial tumors-such as those of lym-
phoid tissue, soft tissue, bone, and cartilage (i.e., lymphoma
and sarcoma)-are not included. Histologic confirmation of
diagnosis is required.

##### Histology Codes

This list includes histology codes and preferred terms from
the WHO Classification of Tumors and the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Most of
the terms in this list represent malignant behavior. For cancer
reporting purposes, behavior codes /3 (denoting malignant
neoplasms), /2 (denoting in situ neoplasms), and in some
cases /1 (denoting neoplasms with uncertain and unknown
behavior) may be appended to the 4-digit histology codes to
create a complete morphology code.

# INTRODUCTION

Approximately 55 % of all mucosal melanomas (MMs) arise
in the head and neck region. This disease represents less than
1 % of all melanomas.1 MM is an aggressive neoplasm that
exhibits unique features relative to other paranasal sinus and
head and neck malignancies, as well as features distinct from
cutaneous melanoma. Approximately two thirds of these
lesions arise in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, one
quarter are found in the oral cavity, and the remainder occur
sporadically in other mucosal sites of the head and neck.

MM is an aggressive neoplasm with staging introduced in
the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer
Staging Manual, 7th Edition for separate consideration from
other mucosal-based lesions. The utility of this new system
has been confirmed.2-5

The staging system of Ballantyne showed its utility and
emerged as the first staging system utilized specifically for
MM.6 The TNM system for paranasal sinus cancer was
not designed for and did not discriminate differences in
prognosis between the various stages in MM. It also did not
provide a staging system for MMs of the other potential sites
where disease arose in the head and neck. Therefore, in the
7th Edition, AJCC and the Union for International Cancer
Control (UICC) adopted a novel system for MM using only
T3, T4a, and T4b categories to characterize the local extent
of disease. The lack of clear discrimination in outcomes
based on the number and size of nodal metastases resulted
in adopting a dichotomous categorization of NO versus N+.
Thus, the four stages of disease for MM are represented by
III, IVA, IVB, and IVC. The system omits T1 and T2 catego-
ries, justified by the overall poor prognosis for even small
superficial lesions. Stratification into these stages assists the
clinician in treatment decision making. In Stage III disease,
the role of radiation still is not completely certain, but should
be strongly considered according to National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations; in Stage IVA,
local radiation is important and confers a survival benefit.7

Stage IVB denotes extensive local invasion for which
treatment often is a nonsurgical approach for local palliation.

Stage IVC denotes distant metastatic disease.7 This stage
designation allows patients to understand their prognosis.
Furthermore, it provides a starting point for worldwide data
collection and analysis. At this time, key genetic mutations
such as BRAF are rarely seen in MM, thus making systemic
treatment with targeted agents problematic.1


# ANATOMY


## Primary Site(s)

MMs occur throughout the mucosa of the upper aerodiges-
tive tract. For a description of anatomy, refer to the appropri-
ate anatomic site chapter based on the location of the mucosal
melanoma (e.g., paranasal sinus and oral cavity).

MM originates from benign intramucosal melanocytes
that reside in the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract
(paranasal sinuses, oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx).

There is no TO category for MM, because melanoma of
unknown primary is unlikely to arise from the mucosal sur-
faces and far more likely to arise from skin.


## Regional Lymph Nodes

The cervical nodes are the primary lymphatic drainage, and
those at risk are in the basin that corresponds to the anatomic
site where the tumor arises. Due to the rarity of the disease,
the role of nodal metastasis is confined to either present (N+)
or absent (NO). At this time, the role of extranodal extension
(ENE) is unknown and this modifier is not incorporated into
the system for MM.


## Metastatic Sites

Distant metastases are common at some point in the course
of the disease. The most common sites are lung and liver.8


## RULES FOR CLASSIFICATION


### Clinical Classification

MM tends to occur in older patients, as compared with cuta-
neous melanoma. MM can occur in any mucosal surface of
the head and neck. The majority arise, however, in the para-
nasal sinuses and nasal cavity, with the remainder primarily
in the oral cavity. Presenting symptoms depend on the tumor
site of origin. Nasal obstruction, bleeding, and a polypoid
mass are the most common symptoms. In the oral cavity, a
painless pigmented mass, often on the hard palate or alveolus
is the typical presenting finding.1 Up to 40% of head and

neck MMs may be amelanotic. Nodal disease occurs in up to
15 % of patients with oral cavity MM.

Clinical staging of MM is done through clinical
examination, appropriate imaging, and histological
confirmation of disease. Pathological staging is done after
surgical resection. Even small MMs behave aggressively, with
high rates of recurrence and death. Because even superficial
MMs exhibit this aggressive behavior, there is no T1 or T2
category in the MM staging system. Thus, primary cancers
limited to the mucosa and underlying soft tissue are considered
T3 lesions. Advanced MMs are classified as T4a and T4b. The
anatomic extent criteria to define moderately advanced (T4a)
and very advanced (T4b) disease are given below. In situ MMs
are extremely rare and are excluded from staging.


### Imaging

Imaging recommendations for MM differ from those for
other head and neck cancers. T3 disease is defined as mucosa
and immediately adjacent soft tissue. Mucosal lesions often
are superficial and may be evaluated easily by direct visual-
ization and palpation or endoscopy. Superficial mucosal
lesions that are assessed easily and confidently may not
require any imaging. Computed tomography (CT) and mag-
netic resonance (MR) imaging studies can be performed or
reconstructed in planes that are orthogonal to the tumor and
can potentially assess the depth of tumor invasion.

Imaging can be helpful for lesions that cannot be fully
assessed on clinical examination and for locally advanced
disease or symptomatic patients. Either CT or MR imaging
may be performed for determining soft tissue involvement
(T4a). CT is superior to MR imaging to identify early cortical
involvement, but MR imaging is superior to CT for bone
marrow invasion. Both CT and MR imaging may be used to
evaluate for spread to the masticator, carotid, or pre-vertebral
space (T4b).MR imaging, however, is superior to CT for
identifying involvement of the skull base, dura, or other types
of intracranial extension (T4b). MR imaging also is superior
to CT to evaluate for perineural spread of "named" nerves,
which should be distinguished from microscopic "perineural
invasion." Positron emission tomography (PET) using 2-deoxy-
2[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is not very useful to evaluate
the primary site or locoregional spread. However, PET-FDG
may be helpful to screen for distant metastases in patients with
local advanced disease. The role of imaging in evaluating nodal
metastases is discussed in Chapter 6, Cervical Lymph Nodes
and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and Neck.

Radiology reports should include information on the
following:

1\. Primary tumor: primary site and locoregional spread
with specific mention of structures that would change
staging to T4a or T4b

2\. Status of lymph node metastases

3\. Presence of distant spread

### Pathological Classification

Pathological staging is assigned after surgical resection.
Margin status and invasion of bone, cartilage, dura, and other
resected tissue should be documented. If a lymph node dis-
section is performed, the number of lymph nodes resected,
the size and number of positive lymph nodes, and the pres-
ence of soft tissue invasion should be noted.


### PROGNOSTIC FACTORS


#### Prognostic Factors Required for Stage Grouping

Beyond the factors used to assign T, N, or M categories, no
additional prognostic factors are required for stage
grouping.


#### Additional Factors Recommended for Clinical Care

As with all cancers, the overall frailty and comorbidities of
the patient are important determinants of prognosis. MM has
few defined disease-specific prognostic factors. The site of
origin in the head and neck is one of the only clear prognos-
tic factors. Disease in the oral cavity has a higher rate of
cervical nodal metastasis than those arising in the paranasal
sinuses. Overall 5-year survival is 15-30% for nasal cavity,
12% for oral cavity, and 0-5 % for paranasal sinus disease.9-11
Other series have demonstrated slightly better outcomes, but
the relative proportion of survival remains best for nasal cav-
ity and worst for paranasal sinus.

Prasad and colleagues proposed a microstaging system
for MM. They reported that findings of vascular invasion,
polymorphous tumor population, and necrosis conferred a
worse prognosis.12 Others, however, have not confirmed
these findings and suggest high mitotic index and other find-
ings are more salient. At this time, it appears that no clear
prognostic factors exist for MM, although many promising
candidates exist; collection of these data for future editions is
advantageous.

In addition to the importance of the TNM factors, the
overall health of these patients clearly influences outcome.
An ongoing effort to better assess prognosis using both
tumor and nontumor-related factors is underway. Chart
abstraction will continue to be performed by cancer regis-
trars to obtain important information regarding specific fac-
tors related to prognosis. These data then will be used to
further hone the predictive power of the staging system in
future revisions.


### Comorbidity

Comorbidity can be classified by specific measures of
additional medical illnesses. Accurate reporting of all illnesses
in the patient's medical record is essential to assessment of
these parameters. General performance measures are helpful
in predicting survival. The AJCC strongly recommends the
clinician report performance status using the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky
performance measures, along with standard staging
information. An interrelationship between each of the major
performance tools exists. AJCC Level of Evidence: II13

### Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol abuse nega-
tively influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking in
pack-years and alcohol in number of days drinking per week
and number of drinks per day will provide important data for
future analysis. Nutrition is important to prognosis and will
be indirectly measured by weight loss of>5% of body
weight in the previous 6 months.14 Depression adversely
affects quality of life and survival. Notation of a previous or
current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the
medical record.15 AJCC Level of Evidence: III


### Tobacco Use

The role of tobacco as a negative prognostic factor is well
established. Exactly how this could be codified in the staging
system, however, is less clear. At this time, smoking is known
to have a deleterious effect on prognosis but it is difficult to
accurately apply this to the staging system. AJCC Level of
Evidence: III

Smoking history should be collected as an important
element of the demographics and may be included in
Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum
standard should classify smoking history as never, ≤ 10
pack-years, > 10 but ≤20 pack-years, or>20 pack-years.
